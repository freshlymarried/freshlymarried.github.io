The same thing happens when I want to get a “just because” gift for him, or create a special date night for us. Add these up and we’ve got AT LEAST  5 times throughout the year searching for gift ideas.</p><p>Over the past few years, I have been keeping track of some awesome finds that interest me or my spouse, and I think most spouses would love too. Soooo I’m FINALLY compiling that list in a blog post to share with you, in hopes that it can help those special occasion or “just because” gifts easier to find!</p><p><strong>I’ll also preface these ideas by saying that most of these suggestions are activities, rather than objects because I believe some of the best gifts should come with the opportunity to connect in some way :) So scroll through finding the category that best fits what kind of gift you are looking for!</strong></p><p><em>***Please note that I take the time to research and find items that I would genuinely get for my own marriage.
