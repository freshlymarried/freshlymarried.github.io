I don&rsquo;t remember all of the words that were said, but I think it was about how I almost pulled a &ldquo;your face&rdquo; joke on him. I know, I act like a twelve-year-old sometimes because I say &ldquo;your face is a _____ &ldquo;(fill in the blank), whenever the opportunity arises, haha. Well this opportunity, he knew it was coming after he created the perfect set up, so he said it before I could say it. I just laughed and said,  &ldquo;Hey! How did you know I was going to say that?&rdquo; He replied with, &ldquo;Because you always say that. It&rsquo;s just like how I know you&rsquo;re going to start singing that ___________ song, after I say the words ________________&rdquo; (I put blanks, because I have multiple random songs I sing to multiple certain phrases! haha) We laughed about it, and I said, &ldquo;Am I really that predictable?&rdquo;</p><p>I started thinking about all of the things Trevor knows to expect from me. Like how I save all of our movie and concert ticket stubs. Just last night we went to see, &ldquo;Monuments Men,&rdquo; and I asked for his ticket, saying: &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll need your ticket because you know I save all of our tickets, right?&rdquo; With a silly smirk, and a loving eye-roll, he handed over his ticket. It was just another thing Trevor has come to know and expect from me! It&rsquo;s funny how much we get used to our spouses overtime. For us, it&rsquo;s only been 11 months. Are there predictable things that you or your spouse do often? I bet there are! Take a minute and thing about it.</p><h4 id=predictable-vs-unpredictable>Predictable vs. Unpredictable</h4><p>Is predictable a bad thing? Is it bad to be a predictable spouse, or have a predictable marriage? I don&rsquo;t necessarily feel like being predictable is a bad thing. For me, it makes me feel like Trevor knows me. I would rather my husband know me this way, rather than be worried because he doesn&rsquo;t know what to expect. Yes, we do or say the same old things, but unless we are getting bored of it, I don&rsquo;t see a problem. Maybe that&rsquo;s the key; to mix things up every once in awhile. Do something that would surprise your spouse. I love those times when I assume Trevor won&rsquo;t want to do something we&rsquo;ve been invited to, and then he corrects me and says, &ldquo;I actually used to do that all of the time, so let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s nice to learn new things about your spouse, huh?</p><p>I&rsquo;m definitely going to continue saving our ticket stubs, because I enjoy saving our memorabilia, because I&rsquo;m crazy sentimental like that. I won&rsquo;t stop my random singing, because that&rsquo;s me! However, maybe I&rsquo;ll start singing different things, or at different moments, haha. I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say, is be yourself, even if that&rsquo;s predictable, but also be surprising at times&mldr; If that makes sense!</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/all class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">all</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/communication class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">communication</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/dates class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">dates</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/funny class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">funny</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/journal class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">journal</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/romance class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">romance</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/couch-potatoes/>Couch Potatoes</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/365-date-night-ideas/>365 Date Night Ideas</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/365-days-of-love/>365 Days of Love</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/i-love-love-notes/>I Love Love Notes</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/the-three-month-milestone/>The Three Month Milestone</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/my-best-friends-weddings/>My Best Friend's Wedding(s)</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/buns-bananas-and-bbq-chicken/>Buns, Bananas, And BBQ Chicken</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/golden-bunnies/>The Easter Bunny</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/cereal-its-whats-for-dinner/>Cereal: It's What's For Dinner</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/national-old-stuff-day/>National Old Stuff Day</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/of-things-that-matter-most/>Of Things That Matter Most</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/quiet-love/>Quiet Love</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/married-at-22-and-proud-of-it/>Married at 22, And Proud of It</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/lets-commemorate-something/>Six Month Anniversary - Let's Commemorate Something</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/you-are-the-most-beautiful-creature/>You Are The Most Beautiful Creature On Planet Earth</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.com>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
