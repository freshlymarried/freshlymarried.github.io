Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t like the song that these words come from, haha. I will credit the band and the song though anyways. The lyrics come from the song, &ldquo;I Know How The River Feels,&rdquo; by Diamond Rio.</p><p><img src=/images/the-sea.png alt="I know how the river feels, diamond rio"></p><p>As a young adult, there were so many directions to go, and many crucial life decisions coming at me. For years I didn&rsquo;t know where I needed to be, until I felt ready for my ultimate goal: to find my eternal companion. What a journey that was. Think about your own journey of how you ended up with your spouse. Was it long? Did you encounter some rough waters? When I think about this quote, I realize that we are all just rivers trying to find our sea. And for those of us who have found it, we now know those feelings of peace and overwhelming love. I am thankful that I get to feel that each and every day with Trevor.</p><h4 id=the-history>The History</h4><p>This week is our first wedding anniversary, so I felt like this was the perfect time to share it. Especially since I included this in my speech at our wedding dinner. This quote was specifically for Trevor, as those words were no truer than that day, where our love was given to us for eternity. My personal journey in getting there was a difficult one. I traveled through rough waters experiencing much heartache and personal struggle. In trying to overcome these trials, it came to the point that I couldn&rsquo;t progress any further on my own, and that&rsquo;s when Trevor came into my life. When I knew he was the one, it felt like I had finally found my home. <em>He</em> was my home. Everything felt like it truly was meant to be. And at that point, I knew that journey was through.</p><p>I&rsquo;m not sure what you would call this next journey of ours that we are on, but I have enjoyed every day of this last year with him, as we have traveled on this road together. Here&rsquo;s to many more years to come!</p><p>Everyone enjoys a lovely quote, especially the personal and more meaningful ones. Share with us one of your favorite love quotes, and why it means so much to you!</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/all class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">all</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/journal class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">journal</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/quotes class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">quotes</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/romance class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">romance</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/scissors-and-glue/>Scissors and Glue</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/i-love-love-notes/>I Love Love Notes</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/so-predictable/>So Predictable</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/quiet-love/>Quiet Love</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/married-at-22-and-proud-of-it/>Married at 22, And Proud of It</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/365-days-of-love/>365 Days of Love</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/six-month-anniversary-lets-commemorate-something/>Six Month Anniversary - Let's Commemorate Something</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/you-are-the-most-beautiful-creature-on-planet-earth/>You Are The Most Beautiful Creature On Planet Earth</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/never-stop-holding-hands/>Never Stop Holding Hands</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/quotation-marks/>Quotation Marks</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/surgery-one-of-lifes-pause-buttons/>Surgery: One Of Life's Pause Buttons</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/the-three-month-milestone/>The Three Month Milestone</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/lds-weddings-101-our-wedding-day/>LDS Weddings 101: Our Wedding Day</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/lds-weddings-101-the-planning/>LDS Weddings 101: The Planning</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/marriage-is-the-best/>Marriage Is The Best</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.github.io>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
