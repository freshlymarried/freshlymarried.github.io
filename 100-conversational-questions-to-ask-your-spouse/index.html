And one of the best ways people try to accomplish this is through asking each other questions. Just when you think, “I don’t know what to ask my spouse because I already know pretty much everything about them!” THINK AGAIN!</p><p>If you’re like me and my husband, you have searched online for different questions to ask your spouse while at dinner. We have asked each other questions from a few different resources, but I’ll be honest, I haven’t found a single resource for questions that are ideal for married couples. What I mean is that <strong>married couples need questions that meet the following criteria: 1) the questions go beyond the basics that we should already know because those conversations can get dull and 2) they avoid questions that are too serious for date night because they have the potential to cause an argument.</strong></p><p>So Trevor suggested that I write a blog post of my own consisting of great conversational questions that were light-hearted and engaging! Ones that are perfect for married couples to ask on date night, road trips, or during any other quality time spent together! So here are 100 different questions you can ask your spouse while you&rsquo;re just sitting there waiting for your food to come!</p><p><img src=/images/rawpixel-com-423663-unsplash.jpg alt="date night, date night questions, questions to ask your spouse, 100 questions to ask someone, 100 get to know you questions, get to know you questions, get to know you questions for your spouse, marriage, marriage advice, newlywed help, date night ideas, date night, date ideas, fun date ideas, dinner date questions"></p><hr><h2 id=100-conversational-questions-to-ask-your-spouse>100 Conversational Questions to ask your spouse</h2><ol><li>If you could relive a year in your life, what age would you choose?</li><li>What physical features of mine do you hope our kids receive?</li><li>What is your favorite date of ours?</li><li>Have you ever been in a studio audience for a tv show?</li><li>If you had to do an extreme sport, what would you do?</li><li>What is a favorite charity you love and why?</li><li>When was the last time you read a magazine, played a CD, or read from a physical book?</li><li>Which of your parents are you most like?</li><li>Which of your siblings are you most like?</li><li>What’s a new hobby you’ve always wanted to try?</li><li>What’s something you’ve always wanted to learn how to do?</li><li>If you won the lottery, what would you do with the money?</li><li>What does your ideal day look like?</li><li>What would you do with a week of solitary confinement?</li><li>What’s another career that you think you would enjoy?</li><li>What famous person would you want to meet and why?</li><li>If you could pick your own “Avengers” team of 6 people, who would be on your time and why?</li><li>Are you an optimist, pessimist, or a realist?</li><li>What do you want to name a pet, or your next pet?</li><li>If you bought a boat, what would you name it?</li><li>What job do you think you would have if you lived in the early 1900’s?</li><li>Who do you wish we lived closer to?</li><li>Which game show do you think you could win?</li><li>What genre of books would you spend the most time looking through in a bookstore?</li><li>How many days could you go without electricity?</li><li>How many days could you go without a phone?</li><li>How many telephone numbers do you actually have memorized?</li><li>If you went on a game show, which one would you want to be on?</li><li>What is the funniest prank you’ve ever played on someone?</li><li>Have you ever gotten in trouble playing a prank on someone?</li><li>Would you ever drive across the country in an RV?</li><li>If you could have a free punch to someone’s face, who would it be and why?</li><li>Do you think today’s generation of youth have it tougher than you did?</li><li>Would you like to be on a jury?</li><li>Do you think life on another planet could be discovered in our lifetime?</li><li>Who is your favorite late night tv show host?</li><li>What does your ideal Saturday look like in the Winter?
