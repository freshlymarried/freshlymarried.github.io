We are on a Caribbean cruise ringing in the new year, so it&rsquo;s a little belated from me! That&rsquo;s also the reason why we just barely did our annual dinner date night where we share and discuss our goals for the year together. We typically do it on New Year&rsquo;s Eve but we felt like saving it until we got home from our trip. Especially because this fun stuff was going on!</p><p>[video width=&ldquo;1280&rdquo; height=&ldquo;720&rdquo; m4v=&ldquo;<a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG>http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/IMG</a>_0234.m4v&rdquo;][/video]</p><p>As I&rsquo;ve mentioned before on how we typically set goals together, we tend to focus in these four areas: Personal, Spiritual, Marital, Professional.My husband is a pretty good goal-setter and is VERY organized and just proactive on a daily basis at accomplishing the things he has set out to do on a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly basis. It makes me very proud of him, but it&rsquo;s also hard for me to be on the same level, haha. The goals I have set this year I think will help me prioritize and organize my life a little better so that I can be on such a go-getter level like he is.</p><p>One thing he suggested to me is that I should have more attainable goals, and I think it&rsquo;s great advice, even though I think I can do everything. I&rsquo;ve thought a lot about this which is why I chose to focus on pretty much one main goal in each of these areas. <strong>My marriage goal this year is to be a better supporter and example of improving our physical health.</strong> I have kind of set this goal before but the stupid allergies fiasco reaaaaaalllllly threw a curve ball at us, but also I just have junk food habits that I&rsquo;m not proud of and it influences him more than I realized.</p><p>This goal is obviously going to have some personal benefits to it, but the best part is that when we are both supporting each other&rsquo;s diet and exercise, we are supporting the emotional and physical intimacy of our marriage as well!</p><hr><h2 id=the-hard-part>The Hard part</h2><p>I find that writing goals down and even sharing them publically can increase accountability so there you go! I shared it here and I hope we can kick some bad eating habits, switch them with some good eating habits, and look and feel healthier! HOWEVER, this decision is the easy part to goal-setting. The hard part is following through with it.</p><p><img src=/images/A-goal-without-a-plan-is-just-a-wish.png alt="antoine de saint exupery, antoine de saint exupery quotes, a goal without a plan, a goal without a plan is just a wish, marriage goals, setting goals in marriage, a new marriage, a new year for marriage, goal setting, setting goals, tips for setting goals, tips for goals in marriage, a marriage goal, new year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions, new year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions for marriage, marriage advice, newlywed advice, marriage quotes, quotes about goals, quotes about goal setting, marriage help, marriage"></p><p>So it&rsquo;s important to make a plan for accomplishing this goal. I&rsquo;ve shared with my husband how I plan to work at this goal, and though I might not be as diligent at times, the steps I take mean progress. That&rsquo;s what goals are all about, making progress!</p><p>We also decided on a new thing we are going to try that will help us both check in on our weekly progress. We try to do a weekly planning on Sundays or Mondays, where we go over each other&rsquo;s calendar items for the week and even ask each other on a date night. We think it&rsquo;s a good idea to review how our goals are coming for the past week, too. It will help us stay on the mindset and give a chance to support each other in our goals by sharing the positive things we&rsquo;ve seen each other do, as well as give constructive criticism on how we can do better. Some people would call this a &ldquo;companionship inventory&rdquo; or a &ldquo;marriage meeting.&rdquo; Whatever it&rsquo;s called, I&rsquo;m looking forward to it.</p><hr><p>I hope this inspires you to make a marriage goal this year of something you can work on to improve your marriage. Make a plan of action and put forth the effort. Maybe set a reminder on your phone. Either way, I wish you luck on accomplishing all your goals this year! Freshly Married is here as a resource to help marriage goals get accomplished, so stay with me here and we can strengthen our marriages together. Wish us luck on accomplishing our goals, too! We will need it :)</p><p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_6128&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;589&rdquo;]<img src=/images/0L0A0673.jpg alt="antoine de saint exupery, antoine de saint exupery quotes, a goal without a plan, a goal without a plan is just a wish, marriage goals, setting goals in marriage, a new marriage, a new year for marriage, goal setting, setting goals, tips for setting goals, tips for goals in marriage, a marriage goal, new year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions, new year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions for marriage, marriage advice, newlywed advice, marriage quotes, quotes about goals, quotes about goal setting, marriage help, marriage"> photo: Four Seasons Photography[/caption]</p><p>What are YOUR goals this year?</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/all class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">all</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/effort class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">effort</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/goals class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">goals</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/journal class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">journal</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/reaching-your-health-goals-together-or-individually/>Reaching Your Health Goals: Together or Individually?</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/financial-independence/>Financial Independence</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/yelling-is-not-cool/>Yelling is Not Cool</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/why-an-associate-degree-is-a-big-deal-to-me/>Why An Associate Degree Is a Big Deal To Me</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/you-are-my-happy/>You Are My Happy</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/the-date-night-bucket-list/>The Date Night Bucket List</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/grocery-budgeting/>Grocery Budgeting</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/do-your-best/>Do Your Best</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/preparing-for-the-zombie-apocalypse/>Preparing For The Zombie Apocalypse</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/be-joyful/>Be Joyful</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/marriage-is-hard-work/>Marriage is "Hard Work"</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/depression-in-your-marriage-the-dos-and-donts/>Depression in Your Marriage: The Do's and Don'ts</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/freshfridays-quote-look-for-the-virtues/>#freshfridays Quote: Look For The Virtues</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/6-ways-to-prioritize-your-spouse/>6 Ways to Prioritize Your Spouse</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/a-marriage-is-a-family-too/>A Marriage is a Family, Too</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.github.io>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
