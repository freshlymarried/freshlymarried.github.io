There have been some interesting findings that have come from a blog post I wrote a few months ago, and I would like to share those with you.
A few months back, I wrote my long-held opinion on bikinis, in the post: &ldquo;Save it For Your Husband.&rdquo; I suggest reading it if you haven&rsquo;t yet, as it can shed some more light on this current post."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.101.0"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.4db9b634643fd35508199f862a8657d2b3f3059bac767df55139f712e79f4de3.css><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/images/favicon.png type=image/x-icon><meta property="og:title" content="Save it For Your Husband - Part Two"><meta property="og:description" content="Feel free to LISTEN to this blog post below!

findings that have come from a blog post I wrote a few months ago, and I would like to share those with you.</p><p>A few months back, I wrote my long-held opinion on bikinis, in the post: <a href=http://freshlymarried.com/save-it-for-your-husband/>&ldquo;Save it For Your Husband.&rdquo;</a> I suggest reading it if you haven&rsquo;t yet, as it can shed some more light on this current post. The main points I brought up were how bikinis are in many ways, immodest, and how bikinis are pretty much lingerie in a different fabric. The biggest point I made, however, was how I think wearing bikinis in public can be disrespectful to husbands. The reason I said that was because special parts of your body are more revealed than normal, and they are revealed to everybody &mdash; with an emphasis on teenage boys and men. I proposed the question of whether husbands feel like their wife wearing a bikini in public was inappropriate or not. Though I&rsquo;m not sure if anyone had this conversation with their spouse, I&rsquo;ve gotten a feeling in the past two months, that I&rsquo;m not the only one questioning it&mldr;</p><h3 id=heres-why>Here&rsquo;s why:</h3><p>I looked at the analytics of our blog, specifically at the phrases people searched for that brought them to our blog. Ever since I wrote that post, more than half of the search phrases had something to do with my question. Here are a few of those phrases searched for:</p><ul><li><blockquote><p>&ldquo;do men like it when their wife wears a bikini&rdquo;</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>&ldquo;Bikini in front of husband&rdquo;</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>&ldquo;bikini wives&rdquo;</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>&ldquo;do husband like when their wives wear revealing clothes&rdquo;</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wear sexy dress because I respect my husband&rdquo;</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>&ldquo;should a wife wear a bikini&rdquo;</p></blockquote></li><li><blockquote><p>&ldquo;tiny bikini with friends OK?&rdquo;</p></blockquote></li></ul><p>This doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that this is a common thing people question. However, it tells me that people are not only questioning it, but they are thinking about it enough to prompt an internet search for understanding of it. There was also a phrase that particularly made me sad to see in the results:</p><blockquote><p><strong>&ldquo;how to tell your friend not to wear skimpy bikini in front of your husband.&rdquo;</strong></p></blockquote><p>HOW UNCOMFORTABLE AND DISAPPOINTING IS THAT SITUATION?! Aside from how it can make your own husband feel, there&rsquo;s also the possibility that you are disrespecting your friend and her husband by wearing that bikini. This was something I didn&rsquo;t think about in the original post, and after seeing that searched phrase, I felt like it was anothEr important and startling reason to choose not to wear a bikini.</p><p><img src=/images/photo-1445075788823-f907c29aae58.jpeg alt="why I choose not to wear a bikini, saving sexiness for our husbands, modesty, lingerie, lingerie in marriage, opinions on bikinis, what a bikini does to your marriage, marriage advice, newlywed advice, marriage specialist"></p><hr><h3 id=the-instigator>The instigator</h3><p>Our choices affect so many people, whether or not we are aware of that. This experience of sharing my opinion about the immodesty of bikinis and these findings, have taught me how important our choices in clothing truly are. Even if you feel that your outfit is acceptable, it could make someone else feel uncomfortable. I know that we are all in control of our own emotions. No one makes us feel a certain way; we can choose to feel uncomfortable by a person&rsquo;s outfit. But why would you want to put someone in that position in the first place? We could say the same thing about thinking inappropriate thoughts &ndash; we can choose to think those things about a woman wearing a bikini, but those thoughts have to be instigated by something&mldr; that something is most likely the half-naked body standing in front of them.</p><p>Again, I hate offending people, but I have to share my strong opinion against bikinis. I can&rsquo;t help but feel like the reason women wear them is for sex appeal; To know that they are making heads turn, catching the attention of men and women. They certainly don&rsquo;t look like they would be the comfortable clothing choice in going down a water slide, so that&rsquo;s the conclusion I have come to. It&rsquo;s fine if you want to get the attention of your husband. I mean, what woman doesn&rsquo;t want that? It&rsquo;s a fun and sexy part of marriage, but should it include everyone else&rsquo;s husbands or sons?</p><p>There are other ways to feel good about your body, and there are other ways that people can notice your gorgeous figure without having to reveal intimate parts of your body. Again, just save it for your husband.</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/all class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">all</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/goals class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">goals</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/romance class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">romance</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/sex class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">sex</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/save-it-for-your-husband/>Save It For Your Husband</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/starting-our-second-year/>Starting Our Second Year</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/one-year/>One Year</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/married-at-22-and-proud-of-it/>Married at 22, And Proud of It</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/365-days-of-love/>365 Days of Love</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/never-stop-holding-hands/>Never Stop Holding Hands</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/buns-bananas-and-bbq-chicken/>Buns, Bananas, And BBQ Chicken</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/our-first-apartment/>Our First Apartment</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/what-food-storage-is-for/>What Food Storage is For</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/defending-motherhood/>Defending Motherhood</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/our-house-story-part-2-you-can-learn-a-lot-in-four-days/>Our House Story Part 2: You Can Learn a Lot in Four Days</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/our-house-story-part-1-timing-is-everything/>Our House Story Part 1: Timing is Everything</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/home-is-insert-cliche-here/>Home is {insert cliche here}</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/a-sudden-date-night/>A Sudden Date Night</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/the-music-to-our-marriage/>The Music to Our Marriage</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.github.io>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
