class=tracked>By <strong>Amy Miller</strong></p><time class="f6 mv4 dib tracked" datetime=2014-06-01T00:00:00Z>June 1, 2014</time></header><div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Remember when you first got married, and there&rsquo;s that one (or more for some of us) person who makes the comment, &ldquo;So when are you going to start having babies?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure we can all think of someone who said that to us, right? Some of them are just funny little grandmas just waiting to have more cheeks to pinch! But others can ask in an interrogative way about it, as if they may be upset if you give an answer that doesn&rsquo;t include the thought of immediately having a child. This example, along with other things can cause a feeling of pressure to build up among someone.</p><h4 id=has-this-happened-to-you-before>Has this happened to you before?</h4><p>It has in a friend of mine. I asked her to anonymously give her thoughts on this subject, to help our readers get a better picture of what effect this pressure can have on someone.</p><hr><p>&ldquo;I feel like there is this immense pressure to get married and start cranking out babies. I&rsquo;m only 22. I feel like I&rsquo;m still so young. I can sit here and say that we want to be financially stable, or I want to finish school&mldr; blah blah blah. But the point is, I will have babies <strong>when we feel it is the right time</strong>. It is such a sacred decision. Ultimately it&rsquo;s between you, your husband, and God. No one else.  I hate when I am asked &ldquo;so you&rsquo;ve been married for almost a year now, when are you going to have kids?&rdquo; Or &ldquo;Are you pregnant yet?&rdquo; Like it&rsquo;s expected that that&rsquo;s what needs to be going on in my life right now. Frankly, it&rsquo;s no one else&rsquo;s business.</p><p>I also feel super strongly that it is important to build a relationship with your husband before children come into the mix. I&rsquo;m sure this statement offends some, but I think your relationship with your husband is more important than that of the children&rsquo;s relationship. Afterall, who is going to be their good example? Who is going to teach them to love and respect their spouses? How can I do that if I haven&rsquo;t fully learned how? No one will ever be 100% prepared to have children, but it&rsquo;s all about the timing, and when you feel Heavenly Father is ready to send you one of his precious spirits.&rdquo;</p><hr><p>I have to agree with her point of view. I will first say, however, that I actually haven&rsquo;t felt a lot of pressure from those around me, to start having children. I&rsquo;ve only had a few friends who have made baby announcements recently, and have only had a few comments said to me. When this happens, these are my genuine thoughts, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m so happy for so-and-so! They will make a great mom!&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t feel a large pressure for us to try getting pregnant, because to be honest, a child is just not something we are wanting right now, nor are we ready for. Of course, if I found out tomorrow that I was pregnant for some reason, my feelings would change and I would love it to death, and make things work. Right now, we are just continuing to develop and enjoy our relationship.</p><h4 id=children-are-soooo-stinkin-cute>Children are soooo stinkin&rsquo; cute!</h4><p>I don&rsquo;t want anyone to think I don&rsquo;t like the idea of having kids. I love children! Trevor makes fun of me because I re-watch videos taken of my nieces and nephew, about 18 times in a day.</p><p>[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_2910&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;589&rdquo;]<img src=/images/Wedding-with-kids.jpg alt="having children, pregnancy pressure, pressure to have children, being an aunt"> These are our nieces and nephew. We love them so much! It has been such a joy to be their aunt. These are the only children Trevor and I are enjoying right now.[/caption]</p><p>There is definitely nothing wrong with having kids! It just happens at a different time in life for everyone. It&rsquo;s easier for me to not get tied up in other couples&rsquo; timelines because that is <em>their</em> timeline. I do not have to follow what anyone else is doing, because like the friend above said, that is between each couple and God.</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/all class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">all</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/children class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">children</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/communication class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">communication</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/goals class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">goals</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/on-the-defense/>On The Defense.</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/happy-opportunities/>Happy Opportunities</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/of-things-that-matter-most/>Of Things That Matter Most</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/marriage-guidelines/>Marriage Guidelines</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/five-tips-to-financial-peace-in-marriage/>Five Tips To Financial Peace In Marriage</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/some-peoples-kids/>Some People's Kids</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/one-year/>One Year</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/scissors-and-glue/>Scissors and Glue</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/so-predictable/>So Predictable</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/not-too-cool-for-school/>Not Too Cool for School</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/the-working-family/>The Working Family</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/stars-and-butterflies/>Stars and Butterflies</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/what-is-mine-is-yours/>What is Mine is Yours</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/married-at-22-and-proud-of-it/>Married at 22, And Proud of It</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/365-days-of-love/>365 Days of Love</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.github.io>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
