There are so many positives it brings to your life because it’s a very hopeful concept. We all need things to look forward to, especially if our current life circumstances aren’t ideal. And working towards something feels so purposeful and satisfying, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p><p>There are also great benefits that sharing your hopes and dreams can have on your relationship. For example, thinking about the future together and making goals and plans can be exciting! I also believe that it gives you the opportunity to strengthen your connection with each other in being attracted to your partner’s desires and drive, as well as seeing them want to support you in your dreams.</p><p>For some couples, sharing your hopes and dreams together can come naturally, and maybe it has from the very beginning. For others, maybe it hasn&rsquo;t been as easy to discuss these together.</p><p><img src=/images/glenn-carstens-peters-190592-unsplash.jpg alt="marriage, marriage talks, communication in marriage, dream together, how to dream together as a couple, talking about goals with your spouse, bucket list in marriage, how to make a bucket list in marriage, marriage bucket list, date night ideas, dream catcher date, achieving goals in marriage"></p><hr><h2 id=how-to-dream-together>HOW TO DREAM TOGETHER</h2><p>One fun and easy way to dream together is through “bucket lists,” or creating a list of things you want to do before you “kick the bucket.” This is what &ldquo;dreaming together&rdquo; looks like for my husband and I. We have short-term items like specific activities we want to do, but we also have long-term items like having a vacation home and going on a service mission for our church when we are older. You can see how we do our bucket lists in the blog post: <a href=https://freshlymarried.com/the-date-night-bucket-list/><em>&ldquo;The Date Night Bucket List.&rdquo;</em></a></p><p>I think most people have things floating in the back of their mind about what they would put on a bucket list. However, <strong>are we sharing them with our partners? Are we including our partners in the experiences we want to have and in the goals we want to achieve? Are these items on your list something you can include your partner on?</strong></p><p><img src=/images/emotionally-intelligent-quote.jpg alt="emotionally intelligent couples, gottman quote, john gottman quote, familiar with each other&amp;rsquo;s world. dreaming together, marriage, marriage advice, marriage help, marriage questions, questions to ask your spouse"></p><p>If you feel that you could be better at this, or want to have a fun conversation about your hopes and dreams with your partner, I encourage you to do the following exercise:</p><p><em><strong>EXERCISE:</strong></em> Discuss items on your “bucket list” with each other. Share those items you would like to do soon, and the items you want to do later in life. If there are experiences you could do with another person, ask your partner if they would like to participate with you! Don’t forget the most important part which is to share WHY those items are on your list.</p><h3 id=here-are-some-questions-that-can-be-your-guide><strong>Here are some questions that can be your guide:</strong></h3><ul><li><ul><li><blockquote><p>What items on your bucket list are you most looking forward to doing?</p></blockquote></li></ul></li><li><ul><li><blockquote><p>What is something you’ve always wanted to do but haven’t for whatever reason?</p></blockquote></li></ul></li><li><ul><li><blockquote><p>What would you want for your future family life?</p></blockquote></li></ul></li><li><ul><li><blockquote><p>Are there experiences you have already done that you would want to do again? Would you do them differently or the same?</p></blockquote></li></ul></li><li><ul><li><blockquote><p>Is there something in particular on your bucket list that you would like to do together?</p></blockquote></li></ul></li><li><blockquote><p>Which item on your list would you like to do in the coming year?</p></blockquote><p><img src=/images/dyaa-eldin-103-unsplash.jpg alt="marriage, marriage talks, communication in marriage, dream together, how to dream together as a couple, talking about goals with your spouse, bucket list in marriage, how to make a bucket list in marriage, marriage bucket list, date night ideas, dream catcher date, achieving goals in marriage"></p></li></ul><hr><p>I hope that by having this conversation with your partner, you are able to connect more, further your friendship and love for each other, and get you excited for your future together. And furthermore, I hope it will get you wanting to ACT more on your bucket list!</p><hr><p>Pieces of this article were featured in the August 2018 themed date box from <a href="https://frstre.com/go/?a=19136-4863f8&s=110370-e6b059">Date Night In</a>! If you&rsquo;re interested in having planned and guided date nights delivered to you every month, check them out! As part of this date, we created our own dream catcher together to represent our goals and dreams we want to achieve together. If you are interested in turning this article into a date, it would be neat to make your own dream catcher together and hang it up in your room as a reminder!
