In the short time we have been married, we have learned so much about marriage and about each other. One important thing that I have learned is COMPROMISE!! Compromise is so important, especially if you and your husband have different interests, like Josh and I do.
When Josh and I got married, we promised each other we would not be the stereotypical American couple that ends up in a divorce court in 5 years.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/lets-commemorate-something/ class="link black dim">Six Month Anniversary - Let's Commemorate Something</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Trevor laughs at all the little moments in our relationship I try to commemorate, or that I feel the need to commemorate.
