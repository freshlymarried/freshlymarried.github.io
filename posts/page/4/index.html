It&rsquo;s been such a good exercise for me to do each week because sometimes I have to think a little harder about the joys in life and in marriage. And that has helped me see things deeper in our relationship.
There have been a few things in our marriage this week that has brought me joy! :) But one main thing that I have found joy in this week was in our ultimate cereal date night on Friday!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshly-married-4-year-anniversary-giveaway/ class="link black dim">Freshly Married 4-Year Anniversary Giveaway!</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">HAPPY FOUR YEARS! Four years ago today, I wrote my very first blog post on Freshly Married, called &ldquo;The Iron,&rdquo; about a lesson I learned with an iron (obviously), that taught me what it truly means to be a good wife, even though I had only been married for a few short weeks. Though we&rsquo;ve been married for longer now and have had several more tough experiences than this one, this iron experience helped launch the message behind Freshly Married, which you can read more about here.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/4-reasons-you-should-write-a-will-how-to-do-that/ class="link black dim">4 Reasons You Should Write a Will & How to do it</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Discussing the topic of dying is kind of depressing, I know. But death is also a reality. And unfortunately, for so many couples, it becomes a reality too early on in their marriage, and so unexpectedly. You can only prepare so much in these situations, but guess what? Making a will is something that you CAN prepare for.
After learning about wills and estates in a family finances class, I started realizing how important it is to have a will in place for your family’s protection, especially if you have many assets you want to leave behind for your spouse and children.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-24/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 24</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This picture from last October is one of the most fun moments with some of my family members.

The joy I found in my marriage this week: Effortless, no pressure fun. That seems like something obvious, and yet it&rsquo;s something that can be easily taken for granted.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-23/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 23</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The joy I found in my marriage this week was my husband getting a new job that he was so happy about!
I&rsquo;ve kind of shared it mysteriously on here because we didn&rsquo;t want to say anything until we had good news, but my husband actually got laid off his job a month ago. The decision was based on saving money, not on his performance whatsoever. It was very unexpected and very inconvenient in the timing.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/tips-for-turning-your-house-into-a-home/ class="link black dim">Tips For Turning Your House Into a HOME</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We have been in our house for almost 3 years, this August! It’s awesome to think back on how far we have come with putting it together, and making it feel like HOME.

This event has made me think about the home furnishing and decorating process, what I liked that I did, and what I would do differently.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-22/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 22</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The joy I found in my marriage this week is seeing the door to parenthood open wider. There were two reasons for this joy. This has been our first full week with our new dog, Oli. And though Trevor does most of the responsibilities, we&rsquo;ve both had our eyes further opened to what being a parent is like. Being a &ldquo;dog parent&rdquo; I guess you could say, is a great segway into being a parent for a human, haha.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/spotlight-absence-makes-the-heart-grow-fonder/ class="link black dim">Spotlight: Absence Makes the Heart Grow Fonder</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Introduction How many people can say one of their close childhood friends are in a band; a SUCCESSFUL band at that?!

Because of the frequent traveling between the two of them, she has learned what helps to keep their marriage fresh through the distance and gives great advice on how they have managed that.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-21/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 21</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The joy I found in my marriage this week was adding this little guy to our family :)
I&rsquo;ll preface the story of this joy by saying that I did not think I would ever have a dog, or any pet for that matter. I&rsquo;ve specifically told people I won&rsquo;t have a pet, haha.

Talking too much business stuff - the kids’ schedules, work stress, etc. Not knowing what to talk about, especially if you think you know everything about each other already Bringing up issues that start an argument I think we’ve all found ourselves in one of these situations on our date nights before.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-18/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 18</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I had a couple of joys I found in my marriage this week.
