This morning I went through my old journal from that time we were first dating and it was so special to go back and read all of that.

On a weekend, recently, I was looking at the Instagram stories in my feed and one came up that bothered me. Someone snapped (I guess that&rsquo;s a word now) their entire date night on both Instagram and Snapchat. I don&rsquo;t have Snapchat, but I know this because the captions on Instagram were encouraging followers to also go over there to watch other parts from their date.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/#freshfridays-quotes-hopes-not-fears/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quotes: hopes, not fears</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">There are many choices and decisions to make that come throughout every marriage. Which is why I love this #freshfridays quote.
When we make choices based on our fears it&rsquo;s coming from a place of doubt. But when we make choices based on our hopes, it&rsquo;s coming from a place of faith. Total opposites that can greatly change an attitude and even an outcome, right?
I&rsquo;ve been working on changing this way of thinking for myself lately.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/touch-toes/ class="link black dim">Touch Toes</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Actor Chris Pratt just did and said some things about marriage and family that are too good not to share!

Back in the dating life, I knew a few girls who would shy away from dating guys who played video games, simply because they instantly thought of it associated with a lazy, preoccupied husband. I have to admit that I dated a guy who played video games and at times I felt second to him because of it. So I can see where they got their judgements.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/marriage-is-hard-work/ class="link black dim">Marriage is "Hard Work"</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">If you want ^^this^^ you gotta be willing to work for it [sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;282494134&rdquo; ]
When people say that marriage is &ldquo;hard work&rdquo; (which it is!), it&rsquo;s important to explain what kind of work that means so newlyweds don&rsquo;t think exhaustion and stress is all they are getting into!
I think it&rsquo;s hard work because it&rsquo;s a commitment that you&rsquo;ve never encountered before.
Our friends mean so much to all of us.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/#freshfridays-stop-and-listen/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays: Stop And Listen</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When life gets busy, it&rsquo;s easy to just keep going and going, working at that to-do list.

I love this phrase because though being a spouse has its difficult moments, it&rsquo;s still such a rewarding life! This phrase is all about looking at the positive in marriage! There have been a few rough things we&rsquo;ve had to experience in our marriage, but even in those times I find myself taking on this mindset, that the good outweighs the bad, and that I wouldn&rsquo;t rather be with anyone else :)</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/#freshfridays-what-will-you-do-today/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays: What Will You Do Today</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;282060301&rdquo; ]
This question is so important to the #freshlymarried perspective! I believe that our daily positive actions add up to create a strong marriage, and asking ourselves this question can help us do that.
For those of you wondering what the word &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; has to do with my overall marriage message, you can read more here :) But using a quick example: when restaurants have items specifically made fresh that day and not days earlier, that&rsquo;s a restaurant you want to eat at, right?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-real-love-your-spouse-challenge/ class="link black dim">The Real 'Love Your Spouse' Challenge</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;282060156&rdquo; ]
So I got nominated to do that &lsquo;Love Your Spouse&rsquo; Challenge, but I&rsquo;m not going to do it. It might be surprising since I&rsquo;m a huge advocate of marriage, and that I totally admire this challenge going around! It&rsquo;s important to publically share your feelings about your spouse, acknowledge their talents and how they have influenced your marriage, etc. But I think there can be TOO much of that sometimes.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/#freshfridays-quote-i-have-a-choice/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: I Have a Choice</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I want to gear this #freshfridays quote towards our emotions. No one is in control of our emotions except for ourselves. So when we react terribly towards something our spouse says or does, we have to own that. That’s why I love this quote, reminding me that I get to choose how I react to a situation, but that my choice is also important.
There&rsquo;s a few types of choices, I believe.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/spotlight-marriage-and-medical-school/ class="link black dim">Spotlight: Marriage and Medical School</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">So many great things can come from having a doctor, nurse, etc. in your family; first and foremost having someone knowledgeable to help you when something medically goes wrong, and you don&rsquo;t have to pay the all the fees! Obviously, they have to go through years of medical school in order to get there, making it a long process, especially when you&rsquo;re married. Since there are many spouses who can relate to this situation, I turned to my amazing friend Raquel to give some inspiration and encouragement in this area.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/date-night-pressures/ class="link black dim">Date Night Pressures</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Everyone knows that I&rsquo;m a big promoter of date night. Especially with my giveaways. I just believe that it&rsquo;s important to have time together alone with your spouse. :) But I don&rsquo;t want to give anyone the idea that your time together has to be epic enough to be given the &ldquo;date night&rdquo; title. Date night shouldn&rsquo;t feel pressured.
All quality time is important! And in some life circumstances, we have to take what we can get, right?</div></div></div></div></section><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label=First class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/6/ aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/5/ aria-label="Page 5" class=page-link role=button>5</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/6/ aria-label="Page 6" class=page-link role=button>6</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 7" class=page-link role=button>7</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/8/ aria-label="Page 8" class=page-link role=button>8</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/9/ aria-label="Page 9" class=page-link role=button>9</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/8/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/19/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.github.io>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
