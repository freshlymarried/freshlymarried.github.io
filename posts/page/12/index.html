For the past four or five months on our dates we have been trying to better focus our conversations on ourselves, rather than work, school, and other business.

Whatever the reason for it, getting to this point has been an interesting journey, at least it has been for me! When we first got married the idea of starting a family was a simple goal for us: &ldquo;Not for five years.&rdquo; However as months and months have passed since then, I can tell you now that it&rsquo;s actually not that simple, haha.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/yelling-is-not-cool/ class="link black dim">Yelling is Not Cool</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Story time When we were living in an apartment still, there was a new family that moved in below us; a wife, husband, and a few kids. Since they moved in, almost every day we heard them yelling. The parents would yell at each other, the parents yelled at the kids, and the kids yelled at the parents. I absolutely hated it; I cringed every time. Yes, I cringed because it is annoying, but mainly because it shows that they are were not loving each other and instead were hurting each other.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/my-butter-half/ class="link black dim">My Butter Half</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height"></div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/because-youre-worth-it/ class="link black dim">Because You're Worth It</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Three years ago yesterday, Trevor asked me to be his wife!

Story Time Two weeks before he proposed I had finally decided I was ready and wanted to move to be closer to him in Provo. This was a big deal for me because exactly a year prior to that I did the same thing&ndash; move to Provo to be closer to a boy I was ready to marry.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/hug-more-kiss-more/ class="link black dim">Hug More, Kiss More</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">HUG MORE.

I used to go to Dixie State University (it was Dixie State College when I went), so I lived down in good ole St. George, Utah! I loved it there so much.

So many people right now are thinking about how they can better themselves for the new year. I am doing that right now, too! But one area people tend to forget to make a resolution for is in their relationships. Do I need to mention how awesome and important that is to do in your MARRIAGE?!

A few that I have received better insight into this year are marriages that have a spouse serving in the armed forces, police work, firefighters, or EMT&rsquo;s. Because of their job description and the sacrifice they make to help protect us, they face different challenges in their marriages than other couples might face. Since I do not have first-hand experience in this area, I asked someone who has absolute experience in this to help us understand better.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-difference-between-an-ordinary-marriage-and-an-extraordinary-marriage/ class="link black dim">The Difference Between an Ordinary Marriage and an Extraordinary Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When I watch TV shows that portray a husband and wife relationship, I get annoyed sometimes with how they act towards each other. Examples of this: Wives nagging their husbands and saying they don&rsquo;t do anything for them ever.

They say sarcastic things under their breath at each other.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/5-ways-to-keep-christmas-gifts-a-surprise-from-your-spouse/ class="link black dim">5 Ways to Keep Christmas Gifts a Surprise From Your Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Have you ever had a hard time buying a gift for your spouse while keeping it a surprise?
