I had the reminder of this when I had consistent problems with my laptop computer that was junky, and Trevor suggested that I take over his personal macbook which was much much better than my PC.

I know, I act like a twelve-year-old sometimes because I say &ldquo;your face is a _____ &ldquo;(fill in the blank), whenever the opportunity arises, haha. Well this opportunity, he knew it was coming after he created the perfect set up, so he said it before I could say it.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/golden-bunnies/ class="link black dim">The Easter Bunny</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I remember reading an article last month on Huffington Post called, &ldquo;Can We Bring The Holidays Down A Notch?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a Mom telling about the stress that she feels comes with Holidays while feeling pressure from other moms who seem to make each holiday bigger than the last. I&rsquo;m not a mom with kids who sometimes need to be pampered with gifts on holidays, but as a newlywed, I can relate to feeling that pressure as well.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/not-too-cool-for-school/ class="link black dim">Not Too Cool for School</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">School. There&rsquo;s so much importance that is stressed on getting an education, and going to school. It&rsquo;s something that seems to be on every young-adult&rsquo;s mind, because getting a degree is the next step after high school. It&rsquo;s what everyone is doing, right? Well, not everyone.
It can be harder to accomplish this personal goal when married. The typical cycle around here, is that some couples find it best to have one spouse put school on hold to help support the other spouse&rsquo;s education, with the hope that when they finish, the other spouse can go back and finish.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-working-family/ class="link black dim">The Working Family</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I currently work at a desk job, answering emails and phone calls from customers.

I had just joined the Latter-Day Saint church and Jason returned from his mission in Italy 3 weeks later. So being in &ldquo;missionary mode&rdquo; he and his family gave me the new member lessons and our friendship blossomed from there. We were great friends with no intentions of dating for about a year. Soon we could no longer deny our feelings for each other, dated for about another year, and in March 2013 were sealed for time and all eternity in the Oakland temple.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/couch-potatoes/ class="link black dim">Couch Potatoes</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The past three weeks, Trevor and I have felt like we&rsquo;ve been bums, couch potatoes, or whatever you call it.
