Sometimes we have difficult conversations in marriage, simply because difficult situations happen. Ya know? And sometimes they&rsquo;re difficult conversations over something that is so little, but our emotions get the best of us. That happened twice this week, haha. We get frustrated with each other sometimes but I&rsquo;m proud to say we were able to talk it out/let our feelings subside fairly quickly.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/wife-life-t-shirt-giveaway-on-instagram/ class="link black dim">Wife Life T-shirt Giveaway on Instagram</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I’ve been wanting to do some exciting things for the #monthoflove, which means GIVEAWAYS!

If you haven&rsquo;t seen these t-shirts, they look like this:

In the past few weeks, a few situations have come up that make me look back on everything it took to get where we are now. We both had to go through a lot of learning and heartbreak before meeting each other, and being ready for each other. Even though you have a few tough minutes of remembering those hard times, it all makes you appreciate your relationship for what it is today, ya know?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/ajoyfulmarriage-week-6/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 6</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The joy I found in my marriage this week: the opportunity to take care of my husband as he has had the flu/cold all week!

I don&rsquo;t know a marriage that doesn&rsquo;t give cards or love notes to each other for special occasions or even just for no reason at all! They can seem boring sometimes unless you get a funny one, or one that just has that unique factor&mldr;
WELL. I&rsquo;m going to show you how to make the EASIEST unique card you&rsquo;ve ever seen! It folds and opens in a fun way, you can make at home with supplies you most likely have laying around, and you can embellish it however you want!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/ajoyfulmarriage-week-5/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 5</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The joy I found in my marriage this week: Seeing a month&rsquo;s worth of progress from working at our goals! It&rsquo;s been a month now into the new year, and I have to admit that I didn&rsquo;t have 100% success every week in my goals. HOWEVER, I can say I have still worked at them and have noticed some differences it has made in my marriage and my own life. And that is the whole point of making and pursuing goals, right?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/3-ways-couples-therapy-can-empower-marriage-even-before-the-first-session/ class="link black dim">3 Ways Couples Therapy Can Empower Marriage, Even Before The First Session</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">One day I was flipping through an article on long-lasting celebrity couples, and each couple said something that has helped them be successful in their marriage. Some of the reasons were good, but this one by actor Bryan Cranston (from TV shows Malcolm in the Middle, and Breaking Bad) and his wife of 27 years stuck out to me.
Whether or not couples therapy is successful for them (it seems like it is since they are still married), this statement is so powerful!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/9-misconceptions-about-therapy/ class="link black dim">9 Misconceptions About Therapy</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">To say there are so many stereotypes and stigmas out there associated with therapists and therapy is an understatement. Therapists are often portrayed in movies and TV shows as jokes, and I&rsquo;m not sure why, because seeking help for your mental and emotional state of mind is not a casual or comical thing! It&rsquo;s also just as important to keep yourself emotionally healthy as it is to keep yourself physically healthy!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/seeing-a-therapist-my-own-experiences/ class="link black dim">Seeing a Therapist: My Own Experiences</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I am sharing my experiences because I believe that the more positively we talk about therapy, the less stigma attached to it, and the more likely people are to seek help and actually get the help they need. I have seen a therapist at two different times in my life, and each time was for emotionally difficult situations. I ask for your sensitivity as I get very vulnerable here!
(Just to preface this, I&rsquo;ll refer to both counseling and therapy as one sometimes, just so it&rsquo;s more simple to read, but the two professions are slightly different.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/ajoyfulmarriage-week-4/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 4</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I feel like a lot of things this week have been telling me &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
It&rsquo;s a lot of things that have to do with my physical health mainly, but a few other things as well. Circumstantial things that just happen in the week like having to make two special trips to the grocery store for strawberries, on two different days, and both stores just happen to be completely out of strawberries!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/ajoyfulmarriage-week-3/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 3</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The joy I found in my marriage this week: gratitude. I&rsquo;ve always been grateful for my husband and felt like I have been blessed with a very extraordinary one. But this week as I become more aware of serious marital struggles others are facing, it has made me realize that our own (as in my husband and I) marital struggles aren&rsquo;t so significant as we think they are.
You read books, watch movies and TV shows, and even hear from others of crappy situations marriages find themselves dealing with like affairs or continual dishonesty, but it doesn&rsquo;t hit you how real it all is until you&rsquo;ve actually been married for a few years, and when things happen to people around you.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/disapproving-parents-how-to-handle-it-and-why-you-should-do-that-now/ class="link black dim">Disapproving Parents: How to Handle it and Why You Should Do That Now</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">My heart hurts every time I hear my friends, neighbors, etc. tell me that their parents still don&rsquo;t approve of their spouse. It&rsquo;s hard to listen to them tell me things like, &ldquo;They think he isn&rsquo;t good enough for me&rdquo; or &ldquo;They tried to break us up.&rdquo; These kinds of family situations frustrate me primarily because HELLO PARENTS, IT&rsquo;S AFTER-THE-FACT! THEY HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR YEARS NOW, SO PUT ASIDE YOUR OWN FEELINGS AND SUPPORT THEM INSTEAD OF DISCOURAGE THEM!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/ajoyfulmarriage-week-2/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 2</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A joy in our marriage this week (from my perspective): Getting tickets to see U2 in concert this year!!!

You see, he hates flying.

Some couples at various points in their marriage, lose those fun, romantic sparks. Sadly, some of these couples wait around for the sparks to come back again on their own, which rarely happens. I think they wait around because it seems like a daunting task, right?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/ajoyfulmarriage-week-1/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 1</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Background/reminder This is week 1 of my campaign/project/whatever about focusing on the joys in my marriage.

Since every couple needs to have some games to turn to, especially in the winter time, I figured I would make one big list for us all!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-in-the-middle-of-difficulty/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays quote: In The Middle of Difficulty</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever stop getting inspired by quotes that remind me to look for the lesson through hard times!
If we apply this to marriage, I think the opportunity that #alberteinstein is talking about here are the opportunities to learn something about yourself, your spouse, or the issue.
If our difficulty is disagreeing on something important, I get the chance to see another perspective I didn&rsquo;t see before. I also get the chance to analyze myself and how I can improve.</div></div></div></div></section><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label=First class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/5/ aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/4/ aria-label="Page 4" class=page-link role=button>4</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/5/ aria-label="Page 5" class=page-link role=button>5</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 6" class=page-link role=button>6</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/7/ aria-label="Page 7" class=page-link role=button>7</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/8/ aria-label="Page 8" class=page-link role=button>8</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/7/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/19/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.github.io>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
