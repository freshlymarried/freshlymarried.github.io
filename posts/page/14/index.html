Around 3:30 or 4 pm, my thoughts start to focus on the refrigerator, and pantry, where I figure out what nice meal I can make for us for dinner.

All the world&rsquo;s a stage I think each of us are on a stage.

I fell into some common pitfalls of comparing my life to other people&rsquo;s lives, questioning how &ldquo;real&rdquo; people were, and spending more time being involved in it than I should have (though I wouldn&rsquo;t say I was addicted). These things were lowering my self-worth, and making me feel ungrateful. I snapped out of this phase and realized some important things that have made me and my marriage happier.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/grocery-budgeting/ class="link black dim">Grocery Budgeting</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Wanna know something funny?

I look through the coupons we get in the mail to see if there&rsquo;s a deal on something we actually use or eat, I&rsquo;ll take advantage of good sales going on and stock up in bulk (one of the big suggestions to saving money on groceries), and I&rsquo;ll avoid getting items sometimes that I think are too expensive that week.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/loving-at-arms-length/ class="link black dim">Loving at Arms-Length</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I attended a women&rsquo;s conference with my mom a few weeks ago and I was inspired by one of the speakers who talked about &ldquo;loving at arms-length.&rdquo; It was actually Dawn Armstrong, the mother of the missionary from the movie, &ldquo;Meet the Mormons.&rdquo; She talked about how she has a lot of love for so many people; sometimes people who randomly come along.

Back in college I had to do an assignment relating marriage and relationships to something. It could be an object or an action, we just had to explain why. I found a lot of similarities between hiking and marriage so I wrote all those down here for you! :)
It&rsquo;s a crazy, fun, stressful, scary, beautiful adventure together.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/newlywed-weight-gain/ class="link black dim">Newlywed Weight Gain</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Did any other couples gain weight their first months of year of marriage?

I mean, we took this whole first tier of our wedding cake with us on our honeymoon to eat! haha I guess some of our eating habits changed when we got married vs.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/new-years-resolutions-married-style/ class="link black dim">New Year's Resolutions: Married-Style</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Our first married NYE&rsquo;s in 2013, we went out to dinner to Red Lobster and had a four-course meal discussing our New Year&rsquo;s resolutions. We had a great time enjoying good food, good company, and talking about the goals and desires of our heart. We decided this year we would continue that as a tradition every NYE! So this year we went out to Buffalo Wild Wings (one of our favs) and listed out to each other our plans for the new year, and it was great!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/newlywed-christmas-cards/ class="link black dim">Newlywed Christmas Cards</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We chose to send out Christmas cards for the first time this year, and this was our little insert.

So even though Christmas has come and gone, we hope you can still appreciate our well-wishes to you for the holidays!
I’m not sure if a lot of you send out Christmas cards, but I want to share what we did for those of you thinking about doing it.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/relationship-whiz/ class="link black dim">Relationship Whiz?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">So remember how I am working on a degree in Family Studies, studying all relationships that come with that, and becoming an expert on how to have a good marriage?

On a daily basis I find myself learning something neat about normal family functioning, and how to handle relationships. And of course, when I&rsquo;m learning all of it, I think of the various relationships I have that apply to that idea, and it helps me understand and remember the concept better.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-honeymoon-phase/ class="link black dim">The Honeymoon phase</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When you think about a typical honeymoon (or look back on your own honeymoon), it&rsquo;s a pretty great experience :) This picture is of us on our honeymoon to Park City; a.k.a Our best vacation ever!

There have been some interesting findings that have come from a blog post I wrote a few months ago, and I would like to share those with you.
A few months back, I wrote my long-held opinion on bikinis, in the post: &ldquo;Save it For Your Husband.&rdquo; I suggest reading it if you haven&rsquo;t yet, as it can shed some more light on this current post.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/home-maintenance-probs/ class="link black dim">Home Maintenance Probs</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">As you know, we moved into our first home three weeks ago. We are enjoying it a lot so far :) It&rsquo;s been great to come home to our own place with a lot more space! (I&rsquo;m cool because I rhymed.) There&rsquo;s DEFINITELY some upgrades from an old apartment to a new home, that we&rsquo;ve enjoyed. Like how my stove cooks chicken, and how my oven seems to bake things better!</div></div></div></div></section><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label=First class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/13/ aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/12/ aria-label="Page 12" class=page-link role=button>12</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/13/ aria-label="Page 13" class=page-link role=button>13</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 14" class=page-link role=button>14</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/15/ aria-label="Page 15" class=page-link role=button>15</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/16/ aria-label="Page 16" class=page-link role=button>16</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/15/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/19/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.github.io>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
