Joyful Marriage - Week 40</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We got our wedding rings cut off this week. Sounds weird, I know, but it feels even weirder! Both of our rings have gotten tighter since we first got married, making them harder to take off. After my husband was reading on how that can be dangerous to not be able to take off our rings, he decided he wanted to get a new ring and I totally understand.
I wasn&rsquo;t planning on it when we got to the jeweler, but we ended up cutting my ring off too and are getting it resized.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-39/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 39</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;ve been recovering from Sinus Surgery #2 the past week, and going into it I didn&rsquo;t think I would have a lot to feel joyous about because the first surgery&rsquo;s recovery was horrible. However, the surgery itself went so well, and the recovery afterward was so well that I didn&rsquo;t need to use painkillers hardly. That&rsquo;s a huge win in my book. And even though I experienced a lot of pain a week later due to airplane air pressure, I&rsquo;m still feeling joy that I was able to recover as well as I did!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-38/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 38</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The Joy I found in my marriage this week is simply little surprises that mean so much!
This joy kind of spans over the past two weeks when my husband gifted me with a massage! I really needed it and they are just my weakness. My body needs it. My mind needs it. So this was a gift I was eager to use.
The other &ldquo;gift&rdquo; was a computer monitor for my office.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-37/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 37</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The joy I found in my marriage this week: cute banter :) We love being silly with each other, just like any other couple!

Whenever I give my husband a piece of gum, he ALWAYS gives me the wrapper, haha.

We went to a little Idaho getaway with family this weekend and had a blast doing a whole bunch of outdoorsy adventurous things we haven&rsquo;t yet experienced together, like riding on four-wheelers,fishing and shooting. It&rsquo;s weird that in our 5 years of being together, 4 years of that in marriage, we haven&rsquo;t done these things yet, even though both of our families are outdoor sports adventurists.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/when-one-spouse-wants-sex-more-than-the-other/ class="link black dim">When One Spouse Wants Sex More Than The Other</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links.
A very common complaint among married couples, especially couples that have sexual intimacy problems, is that one spouse seems to want or enjoy sex more than their spouse does. This scenario is a difficult one to provide a one-size-fits-all answer to because there are two different perspectives, with a variety of possible reasons or causes of this gap, and a variety of ideas on how to tackle this situation!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-35/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 35</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m happy to say that I&rsquo;ve truly felt some joys this past week that have left me feeling content with life and my marriage! I have found joy in letting things go. I&rsquo;m trying to not take disagreements so personally, and it allows us to roll them off our back more. I&rsquo;m also trying to let go of things I can&rsquo;t change &ndash; specifically the fact that I have to have a second sinus surgery in a few weeks.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-34/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 34</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m still shocked about Chris Pratt and Anna Farris splitting up 😩. Being a celebrity and being married is not easy. I’ve written about how celebrity marriages face different struggles than everyday marriages face. Even though their marriage ultimately ended, I’m still obsessed with this marriage advice he gave, “At least touch toes.” If you’ve read it, I hope you can see the sense he makes.

Both of these tough situations are prevalent in a marriage that has one or both spouses struggling with mental illness. As I&rsquo;ve shared in a few articles on depression, it&rsquo;s not easy for either spouse to handle, and it truly can affect your marriage in the short-term AND long-term of your relationship.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-33/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 33</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The Joy I found in my marriage this week is trying new things.
And this one is going to be funny because it has to do with trying new foods, which I am not very good at. A few weeks ago my husband even said to me, &ldquo;When I ask if you want to try some of my food and you say, &lsquo;No, I want you to enjoy it&rdquo; I get that means you don&rsquo;t want to try it.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/back-to-school-interview-for-your-spouse/ class="link black dim">Back to School Interview For Your Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Back to School InterviewThis is inspired by an email newsletter I received titled, &ldquo;Interviews aren&rsquo;t just for adults,&rdquo; where I saw a cute picture of a kid holding up one of those back to school/all about me interview papers that people tend to do with their kids every year.

With it being a year of trying and discouragement, it&rsquo;s technically now considered an infertility journey. It&rsquo;s crazy how you can talk about infertility with other people and learn about it, but when it becomes more real for you personally, it becomes this really hard thing to say out loud, or even type.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-31/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 31</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The joy I found in my marriage this week: that feeling when you kiss and make-up.

It sucks when you disappoint each other because you don&rsquo;t agree on something. But it&rsquo;s also a reality of marriage because you are two different people joining your lives together.

She talked about how we sometimes look at people as obstacles, and how doing so gives us such a negative attitude and perspective on our situations with them.

I&rsquo;ve been watching cooking shows lately, and have heard the term &ldquo;elevate&rdquo; be used a lot. It&rsquo;s described as like adding an extra element or level to your dish that gives it a kick to stand out from the typical version of that dish.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-27/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 27</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I don&rsquo;t really like to say we are a mom or dad to our dog Oli, but we do take care of him and parent him in lots of ways. I didn&rsquo;t think I would ever be a &ldquo;dog parent&rdquo; but I&rsquo;ve been finding myself glad that it happened.
And I don&rsquo;t want to be one of those people that posts everything on their dog, haha, but I can&rsquo;t deny the fact that he has brought me some joy this week that directly relates to my marriage, so I&rsquo;m gonna write about it!</div></div></div></div></section><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label=First class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/2/ aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label="Page 1" class=page-link role=button>1</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/2/ aria-label="Page 2" class=page-link role=button>2</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 3" class=page-link role=button>3</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/4/ aria-label="Page 4" class=page-link role=button>4</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/5/ aria-label="Page 5" class=page-link role=button>5</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/4/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/19/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.github.io>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
