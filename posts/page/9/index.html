This week my focus is on the importance of recording the memories in marriage! I talk about how important it is to journal the little details here, with 10 ideas for how you can do that! I also wrote here about how important it is to update your family photos often AND make sure to hang them up in your house!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-married-journal/ class="link black dim">The Married Journal</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I love being right in the middle of a memorable moment when a certain kind of happiness overcomes me, and I can’t help but think, “I will never forget this.” Those moments are deemed “memorable” for whatever reason, and can stay in our hearts forever. As much as we wish they can be replayed over and over, they can’t be; unless you have a time machine in the form of a flying DeLorean, and your name is Doctor Emmett Brown.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/first-big-vacation/ class="link black dim">First Big Vacation</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">So I&rsquo;m finally sharing our beautiful trip to Hawaii we took in May! Two phrases I remember saying multiple times out loud and in mind are: &ldquo;Bucket list item - CHECK!&rdquo; and &ldquo;That&rsquo;s another new thing I can say I tried!&rdquo; I liked being able to make those little steps of progression in life, but doing them felt a million times more special and held more purpose getting to do them with my husband :)</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/message-in-a-bottle/ class="link black dim">Message In a Bottle</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Every anniversary we do a little something to celebrate our love!

Our gift to each other was celebrating in Hawaii this year, but I wanted us to do something special there to mark the occasion.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/marital-tiffs-and-beautiful-beaches/ class="link black dim">Marital Tiffs and Beautiful Beaches</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Arguments, fights, tiffs, quarrels, disagreements, misunderstandings, whatever you call them, are bound to happen here and there in marriage.

So naturally, I felt like doing a milestone post on being married for THREE YEARS! That&rsquo;s such a small number, but I believe every year is an accomplishment! And we&rsquo;ve experienced so much together in this short time, so it gets me excited about what we&rsquo;ll experience at our 30-year mark!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-just-take-the-first-step/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: Just Take the First Step</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Little steps make up the whole staircase anyways, right?

We&rsquo;ve done research to various places, planning, and multiple times were minutes away from actually booking a trip! Yet we haven&rsquo;t pulled the trigger&mldr; until now! We finally did it - we went to HAWAII! Some of you might be saying, &ldquo;Going to Hawaii is this big for you guys?&rdquo; or &ldquo;We go on vacations all the time&mldr;&rdquo; Well, it&rsquo;s different for us, and because it&rsquo;s not something we do often, it will be that much more special :)</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/pray-together-stay-together/ class="link black dim">Pray Together, Stay Together</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This is a common catchphrase in religions, even though it might not be a guarantee. While I believe praying is a powerful tool in marriage, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily guarantee a couple won&rsquo;t get divorced. However, it does pull a large weight when it comes to feeling high marital quality.
I came across a recent article not too long ago from the Institute of Family Studies about how influential religion is in a couple&rsquo;s marital satisfaction.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/intentional-double-dating/ class="link black dim">Intentional Double Dating</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links.
Our time is very valuable as married couples, individuals, and parents. Weekends seem to be dispersed between your own events and obligations, family events, or just plain staying home on a Saturday night relaxing! If you got kids, throw in their games and activities, too. So when it comes to date night, it&rsquo;s rare for some of us to find time for double dates, let alone our own dates!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-greatest-love-story-ever-told-is-your-own/ class="link black dim">The Greatest Love Story Ever Told is Your Own</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">As a society, especially women, we tend to get caught up in other&rsquo;s love stories. The obvious ways we do this are through movies and novels, right? Writers make up these passionate love stories that (most of the time) are unlikely to happen, with the most convenient circumstances. When these stories are played out in movies, of course, we finally get to see it all played out visually so everything is played up.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/if-i-could-go-back/ class="link black dim">If We Could Go Back</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">There are many things in the beginning of marriage that we don&rsquo;t know about or fully understand until we have been married for at least a few years. I&rsquo;m sure you guys have specific situations you ran into that you stressed too much over, or maybe an aspect that you underestimated. Maybe knowing your spouse for longer has helped you know how to handle certain situations better. So for my #freshfridays question I asked:</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-sexy-dice-game/ class="link black dim">The Sexy Dice Game</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m excited to share this idea with you guys because I think it&rsquo;s a fun, EASY way to switch things up when it comes to your sex life!
For whatever reason, we all experience a hiatus of sexual intimacy at times. Sometimes it&rsquo;s because there are natural life transitions happening like having a baby, and other times you&rsquo;re just needing a nudge to get back there. This game can be that nudge for your marriage!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-if-you-could-give-a-newly-married-couple-any-marriage-advice/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays: If You Could Give a Newly-Married Couple Any Marriage Advice</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We are all full of wisdom whether we have been married five days or five decades!

The reason I asked is because this is something my husband and I have been trying to figure out for a while now! I&rsquo;ve seen many couples do workouts together, or go on the same diets. I think it&rsquo;s cool to have it be something you can do together because you get healthy while spending time together, you can encourage each other, and it can be convenient to eat the same meals.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/being-a-married-college-student/ class="link black dim">Being a Married College Student</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m grateful that I was able to experience college being both single, and then married.
