GO ON A DATE! I know I say this a lot, and I don&rsquo;t want to come off as annoying, judge-y or insensitive when I write this post. Life can be tough and in those tough times, we tend to put this incredibly important relationship of ours on the back-burner. It also happens when life is busy.

However, simply having my marriage ceremony within my religion doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m guaranteed to have a happy and healthy marriage! Believing you&rsquo;ll have a forever marriage is different from actually creating one.
Principles to follow I firmly know that the principles taught in my Latter-Day Saint faith and many other faiths directly coincide with principles you should follow for a strong and happy marriage.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-question-you-are-not-a-tree/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: You Are Not a Tree</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I love this. Great advice for life but even better advice for marriage. If your marriage is in a &ldquo;rut&rdquo; you don&rsquo;t have to settle for that stage. You both have the power to make the changes that will put you in a stage you feel happy with. Whether it&rsquo;s making sacrifices, behavioral changes, or getting more outside help, you can make it happen. Think about that as you answer the #freshfridays question: &ldquo;What change can you make TODAY to freshen up your marriage?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-importance-of-family-photos/ class="link black dim">The Importance of Family Photos</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">As you have noticed, we got some new family photos done :) And I&rsquo;m loving them! I had been watching my friend Nicky post so many amazing pictures she has taken of families and couples, and knew that she could give us the memorable photos we were looking for. Throughout the process I was so impressed with her professionalism, expertise, artistic eye, and even encouragement that we looked cute, haha. I just had a really great experience with her and wanted to mention that as I share a few photos from this shoot.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/great-marriages-are-built/ class="link black dim">Great Marriages Are Built Brick by Brick</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">&ldquo;&mldr;That is good news because no matter how flat your relationship may be at present, if you keep adding pebbles of kindness, compassion, listening, sacrifice, understanding, and selflessness, eventually a mighty pyramid will begin to grow.&rdquo; This weekend I watched Latter-Day Saint General Conference and heard some great spiritual messages!

Because I&rsquo;m in this same grouping, it gives me mixed feelings, realizing that divorce truly is a possibility, but that I&rsquo;m glad I have the strong marriage I have.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/christlike-attributes-and-my-marriage/ class="link black dim">Christlike Attributes and My Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I am religious and rely on God and his son, Jesus Christ, in nearly all aspects of my marriage. So I have been wanting to write about how religion influences my marriage. This week as I have been thinking about Easter and Jesus Christ&rsquo;s Atonement, I have been focused on his actions from his time walking among us on earth: the examples he set of kindness, righteousness, and love. These qualities he displayed have become known as &ldquo;Christlike attributes&rdquo; and although there are many attributes that I could apply in my life, there are a few specifically that have been most applicable to my marriage that I wanted to point out.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-what-will-you-do-now-to-keep-your-marriage-fresh/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays: What Will You do Now to Keep Your Marriage Fresh?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">There&rsquo;s no time like the present!

I have to say that I was not looking forward to this birthday just because the things I was wanting to do /to eat (but for reals!) I couldn&rsquo;t have, or were out of reach. I thought that those things would make me happy. I have to admit that I totally cheated on my birthday and had two slices of cheese pizza that tasted so much like paradise that I didn&rsquo;t even regret the inflammation and discomfort I had from it the next two days!</div></div></div></div></section><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label=First class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/9/ aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/8/ aria-label="Page 8" class=page-link role=button>8</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/9/ aria-label="Page 9" class=page-link role=button>9</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 10" class=page-link role=button>10</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/11/ aria-label="Page 11" class=page-link role=button>11</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/12/ aria-label="Page 12" class=page-link role=button>12</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/11/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/19/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.com>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
