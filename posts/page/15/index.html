One of those articles was, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not celebrating bikini season this year&rdquo; by Kit Steinkellner.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/school-is-not-out-for-summer/ class="link black dim">School is Not Out For Summer</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">You&rsquo;ve probably noticed a decrease in posts the past few weeks. (I&rsquo;m sorry for that!) I love our blog, and I love writing posts, but I&rsquo;ve just had my hands busy with school. Yep! After being out of the academic loop for two years, I am back in the game! It&rsquo;s been a slight adjustment with getting back into my nerdy, studious habits, but it&rsquo;s been more of an adjustment with how face-paced summer blocks are.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-pressure-to-have-babies/ class="link black dim">The Pressure to Have Babies</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Remember when you first got married, and there&rsquo;s that one (or more for some of us) person who makes the comment, &ldquo;So when are you going to start having babies?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure we can all think of someone who said that to us, right? Some of them are just funny little grandmas just waiting to have more cheeks to pinch! But others can ask in an interrogative way about it, as if they may be upset if you give an answer that doesn&rsquo;t include the thought of immediately having a child.</div></div></div></div></section><ul class="pagination pagination-default"><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/ aria-label=First class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/14/ aria-label=Previous class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#171;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/13/ aria-label="Page 13" class=page-link role=button>13</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/14/ aria-label="Page 14" class=page-link role=button>14</a></li><li class="page-item active"><a aria-current=page aria-label="Page 15" class=page-link role=button>15</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/16/ aria-label="Page 16" class=page-link role=button>16</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/17/ aria-label="Page 17" class=page-link role=button>17</a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/16/ aria-label=Next class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;</span></a></li><li class=page-item><a href=/posts/page/19/ aria-label=Last class=page-link role=button><span aria-hidden=true>&#187;&#187;</span></a></li></ul></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.github.io>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
