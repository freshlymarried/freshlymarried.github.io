Many of our summer nights lately have consisted of take-out dinner. Somehow it&rsquo;s mostly Mexican food, too, which means Cafe Rio :) We like going to the restaurant itself occasionally but sometimes we are just too pooped from the day, and just want to eat it at home while we watch Monk :) Know what I&rsquo;m saying?! There&rsquo;s been a big question apparently of what the masses prefer: their new Spicy Green Chile Pork, or their classic Sweet Pork.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/depression-in-marriage-how-your-depression-affects-your-spouse/ class="link black dim">Depression in Marriage: How Your Depression Affects Your Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;276708040&rdquo; ]
It&rsquo;s not easy being a spouse to someone who suffers from a depression disorder or anxiety disorder. There&rsquo;s much patience required and it might be harder to understand if you have never experienced it before. Some spouses go into marriage with someone who suffers from depression not knowing how much of a mental and physical toll it can also have on themselves. And sadly, many couples go into marriage thinking that because they are so in love with their soulmate, their depression is gone.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/depression-in-marriage-how-your-spouse-affects-your-depression/ class="link black dim">Depression in Marriage: How Your Spouse Affects Your Depression</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;276707574&rdquo; ]
I love this quote. This reflects what my husband has done for me and I feel nothing but overwhelming gratitude when I think about it. Spouses hold an amazing power to love you through your mistakes and weaknesses. They may be the only people close enough, and willing to understand those mistakes and weaknesses. It&rsquo;s such a vulnerable thing, and for them to still stand by your side and come out loving you MORE is just amazing.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/depression-in-your-marriage-the-dos-and-donts/ class="link black dim">Depression in Your Marriage: The Do's and Don'ts</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;276706899&rdquo; ]
It seems more people have been coming out and sharing that they suffer from depression and/or anxiety. Whether it&rsquo;s just during postpartum or a life-long struggle, it&rsquo;s not easy to battle, and not easy to share with everyone that you are among them. I&rsquo;m grateful that more people are sharing this because it is not uncommon. We all experience hard and even traumatic things, and sometimes the explanation is just that the brain chemicals are imbalanced which causes the bouts of depression.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-power-of-empathy/ class="link black dim">The Power of Empathy</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">“The truth is, Rarely can a response make something better.

She talks about the difference between empathy and sympathy, the mistakes we tend to make when attempting to give empathy, and what we should be doing instead. It&rsquo;s super short, yet super powerful! The animation helps you understand well, too.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/object-lessons-the-marriage-recipe/ class="link black dim">Object Lessons: The Marriage Recipe</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Watch the video, then proceed to the rest of the post below :)

Making your own marriage recipe So you have your ingredients list above, and now you need the directions to follow, but where do you find those directions to follow? 3 ways you find those directions:
You study and learn through credible books, classes, and advice from others. You pull from your past relationship experiences of what worked and what didn&rsquo;t work.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/love-is-spelled-t-i-m-e/ class="link black dim">Love is Spelled T-I-M-E</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Everyone can feel loved differently because we each have different love languages we speak. Sometimes your love needs to be shown in a certain way. However, it requires your time no matter how you show it! Be willing to give up your time to do something special for your spouse, to say something special to them, or just plain be with them :)
Give time to your spouse today!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-marriage-is-like-home-maintenance/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: Marriage is Like Home Maintenance</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The smoke detectors in our house have slowly been going off over the past few months, needing a replacement battery.

It&rsquo;s a word that guides every aspect of my life. Especially lately! At some points progress can be slow-moving (one of those points being marriage!) but I know the day will come for you to see the rewards of your efforts and endurance, and you&rsquo;ll feel strong. But it takes your active participation to get there.
Put in the work to have the marriage you want or you won&rsquo;t get it.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/making-an-effort-two-is-better-than-one/ class="link black dim">How to Try New Techniques, Even If Your Spouse Won't</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The use of techniques are found in our everyday activities; at your job, in your hobbies, cleaning your house, cooking, or driving a car. Each one of these requires the use of a skill or ability that you have learned that has helped you perform better in these various activities. Guess what? This idea can also be applied to your personal roles, such as being a spouse.
It&rsquo;s naive to think that knowing how to be married should come naturally.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-5-to-1-ratio/ class="link black dim">The 5 to 1 Ratio</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">For those of you who don&rsquo;t know John Gottman, he&rsquo;s basically the number one guy in understanding couples and marriages.

I respect him for his many theories in marriage, but this one is one of my favs because it&rsquo;s fairly easy to remember AND it makes a daily impact on your marriage! It&rsquo;s called the 5 to 1 ratio for healthier marriages.
How it works For every 1 negative thing we do in our relationship, it should be accompanied by 5 positive things**.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-look-for-the-virtues/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: Look For The Virtues</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">“…There would be far less of divorce, much less of infidelity, much less of anger and rancor and quarreling.

Looking for the good in your spouse daily — YES that’s DEFINITELY a smart technique to use in marriage!
Look for the good, look for the positive, and look for the reasons why you fell in love with them in the first place.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-abc-formula/ class="link black dim">The ABC Formula</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">One dilemma all marriages find themselves in is how to best tell their partner how they are feeling. What I mean by this is that sometimes when we try bringing up an issue with our spouse, we start it off with blaming or obvious anger. Think of the last time you started off a conversation like this. How did it work out for you?? If a conversation starts off like this, it will most likely end like this too.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/6-ways-to-prioritize-your-spouse/ class="link black dim">6 Ways to Prioritize Your Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A reader asked what I would suggest as ways to prioritize your spouse, and I decided to put all that information in a post because my reply is too big for a comment box! haha. So here&rsquo;s my reply to my previous post: &ldquo;Prioritizing My Spouse.&rdquo;
The idea of growing apart happens gradually over time. When you think about it, there will always be sudden situations that come up where you do need to be there for your kids over your spouse, but I think the problem starts when this is happening frequently.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-marriage-is-a-family-too/ class="link black dim">A Marriage is a Family, Too</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Sometimes I get the feeling that people take marriage for granted or discount its importance. I&rsquo;m not just saying that because I&rsquo;m a marriage guru, or because I don&rsquo;t understand what it&rsquo;s like to have children of my own yet! From conversations I have had with people lately, they have made comments that appear to me as devaluing a family that only consists of husband and wife. It&rsquo;s as if they think a married couple simply on their own isn&rsquo;t good enough, or isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;family&rdquo; compared to a married couple with children.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/invest-more-in-your-marriage-than-in-your-kids/ class="link black dim">Invest More in Your Marriage Than in Your Kids</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A HAPPY AND HEALTHY FAMILY BEGINS WITH MARRIAGE In the previous post connected to this, I discussed how it&rsquo;s becoming more normal to put less importance on marriage and more importance on kids.
