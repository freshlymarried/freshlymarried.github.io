What’s a “White Elephant” gift? It’s a silly gag gift usually for playing a White Elephant game!
How does it work? There&rsquo;s a pile of gifts, one per person who is playing. Everyone draws a number which decides the order they choose a gift from the pile. If you have 13 people/13 gifts, you’ll have numbers 1-13 to draw from. Starting with person #1, they will choose a gift from the pile to unwrap and reveal to everyone.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/5-tips-for-handling-finances-better-in-marriage/ class="link black dim">5 Tips for Handling Finances Better in Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When I originally wrote this draft blog post about 4 years ago, I mentioned that our way of doing things with our finances has been very successful for us, and that we didn&rsquo;t have issues between us due to finances&mldr; WELL, then we bought a house, and cars, and started investing in retirement, got fun medical bills, doing our own side businesses, etc. So our finances got a little more complex, and therefore the responsibilities of managing them got a little bit more intense.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 w-30-l mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/tabletalk-savory-dinner-conversations-for-two/ class="link black dim">#TableTalk -- Savory Dinner Conversations for Two</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">***This article contains affiliate links so if you purchase, I make a small percentage of that.
