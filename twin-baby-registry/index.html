At least, with the material items and their room &mldr; mentally, I’m not sure yet! Haha.  It feels weird that at 31 weeks we already bought everything on our registry that was left over from the generous gifts we received at our baby showers! But at the same time, this twin pregnancy has been unpredictable and a lot has felt out of control, so we would rather be this prepared now than have to handle it all after the arrive and life is chaotic caring for them. </p><p>I received interest from some of you readers about what we were including on our registry so I’m sharing the main essentials we registered for on amazon. Throughout the post I share about WHY we did what we did because I know it sounds crazy to have FOUR cribs. Haha that doesn’t make sense to everyone but you’ll be able to read what our reasonings were behind a lot of the products we got equipped with. </p><p>Also, we chose to exclusively go with one baby registry at Amazon. So at the end, I share some tips and things we liked and didn’t like about it.</p><p>I hope this is helpful for anyone in the twin situation, or who are curious about how things differ with twins.

The idea is that you move the bed panel lower with each stage it suggests so that these can be used from newborn to about a 2-year-old (up to 35" tall or if they can climb out). They were pretty easy to set up, they are up to the safety standards for cribs with the mesh siding to avoid SIDS, and they work for traveling, even if just to grandma&rsquo;s house for Christmas. These were the best choice for us and our twins because it would have been very cramped with two normal size cribs in their room, and we can wheel them from our bedroom to their own room in a smooth transition when that time comes. We just felt like these were the cheapest route instead of having to buy bassinets AND cribs.</p><p><img src=/images/IMG_0116.jpg alt="twin registry, twin baby registry items, baby registry items, twin boys registry, how to create a twin registry, preparing for baby, preparing for twins, what we did for our twins,"></p><p>And yes, we did get two more for our main floor living room! It made sense for us because we can just lay them down safely in their own crib when I need to do chores or something but can keep an eye on them. It also will allow our cute dog Oli to roam free without me worrying he is licking their faces since it&rsquo; too high for him to get into.</p><p><img src=/images/IMG_0120.jpg alt></p><p><em>8-MONTH UPDATE: We have totally used all 4 of these cribs as much as we thought we would and even more! The only drawbacks are that because you don’t put sheets on it, it makes noise with each movement of your baby.

I know many moms swear by these though, especially for doing naps during the day!</p><p><em>8-MONTH UPDATE: We used our sleep sacks OFTEN! By the end of it I had purchased 8 of these first stage small ones because of how often they both used them and sometimes peed in them haha. I did buy 2 of the transitioning sleep sacks that unzip at the shoulder, and our boys ended up transitioning well to having their arms free so they didn&rsquo;t use the zipped arms aspects for longer than a week.

But for times when they need to take a bottle, or if I can only pump, then I can pump directly into these pouches too. Even if we need to go with formula, we can pour the formula into the pouches. We loved that these pouches are designed to mimic the breast so that air pockets don&rsquo;t form.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kiinde-Twist-Squeeze-Natural-Feeding/dp/B00CXRUJYU/ref=as_li_ss_il?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B00CXRUJYU&pd_rd_r=708b2eda-91f7-11e9-90a4-bfdd2be50711&pd_rd_w=frIiK&pd_rd_wg=pj1aV&pf_rd_p=588939de-d3f8-42f1-a3d8-d556eae5797d&pf_rd_r=MW4RCEGVWPCTBKSHE23C&psc=1&refRID=MW4RCEGVWPCTBKSHE23C&linkCode=li2&tag=freshlymarrie-20&linkId=8c005269d20ec173852d5106067a9a25&language=en_US"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00CXRUJYU&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=freshlymarrie-20&language=en_US" alt></a></p><p>It’s a little more expensive than other options but we don’t have to have a million bottles around the house and constantly have to clean them. Instead, we got 4 of these bottle casings, and then a large number of nipples to cycle through the sterilizer. This company had a free trial pack deal going on so we got that first to make sure we understood how it worked and if we wanted to proceed with this option, and we liked it even more.</p><p><img src=/images/6E5AB075-9DC1-40A5-B00A-83C663A9A719-1-768x1024.jpeg alt></p><p><em>8-MONTH UPDATE: We have loved this bottle system! Not only is it great for making their bottles ahead of time, but I have found it’s especially perfect for traveling with. When you have two babies and will be away from the house during 2-3 feedings, that means you’ll have to pack 4-6 bottles in your small diaper bag until you can properly wash and sterilize them. With twins, our diaper bag is already super small so having disposable pouches and just two bottle casings has been a huge convenience. P.S. We have two bottle casings in the diaper bag, two bottle casings for middle of the night/morning feedings in their room, and two more for our main floor. I haven’t felt a need for more.]</em></p><hr><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nest-Security-Camera-Matters-Anywhere/dp/B00WBJGUA2/ref=as_li_ss_il?keywords=nest+camera&qid=1560887751&s=gateway&sr=8-3&linkCode=li2&tag=freshlymarrie-20&linkId=c3ebbe518b8f3ad7ae9cea1250761c3a&language=en_US"><img src="//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00WBJGUA2&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=freshlymarrie-20&language=en_US" alt></a></p><p>We also got a <strong><a href=https://amzn.to/2KoDKzF>Nest Camera, $169</a></strong> for their room that sits over both their cribs.

You don&rsquo;t know what items the 15% is excluded from until you can use the completion discount. I&rsquo;m not sure what the stipulations are but for us, it worked on most items including our stroller and the clothing items, but it did exclude our baby monitors, the car seats, and few other random items.</li><li>As I’ve compared pricing at Target, Carter’s, buybuybaby, Kohl’s, etc, <strong>I’ve found that Amazon can be much cheaper,</strong> even sometimes when you have a coupon or have them on sale.</li><li><strong>Make the larget items contributable</strong> so that people who can only get you a gift of $10, can feel like it went towards something you need.</li><li><strong>The diaper fund is a fun option for people to contribute to.</strong> Especially those who want to help from far away and don’t want to worry about shipping. The nice thing is you don’t have to keep it strictly to buying diapers. It applies the amount to your account like a gift card balance that you can use towards anything.</li><li><strong>The “free” welcome box was out of stock when we did our registry, and then when it came back in stock it never was free</strong>… It would add it to our cart at the cost of $35, haha. So when I saw the ads on Instagram and my emails for the FREE welcome box, I laughed. To be fair, it did say it was a limited supply so I think they just didn’t change the wording.</li><li>I put clothes on the registry knowing that people would like to get cute outfits for us because that’s the most fun to shop for right? But I was also getting so many outfits on my own haha. So <strong>the clothes were mostly on there so people knew what style I was going for</strong>, if they did want to buy clothes elsewhere.</li></ul><hr><p>I plan to do a follow-up in like six months to this blog post, sharing if we would change any items we got! Like if we didn&rsquo;t end up needing 2 of something, or if maybe we decided we didn&rsquo;t have enough. Hopefully by sharing our experiences with baby products will help those who are debating what they really NEED as new parent twins like us, or even one kid!</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/all class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">all</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/celebrate class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">celebrate</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/children class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">children</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/gender-reveal/>Gender Reveal!</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/my-words-of-the-year/>My Words of The Year</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/6-ways-to-prioritize-your-spouse/>6 Ways to Prioritize Your Spouse</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/the-pressures-of-newlywed-bucket-lists/>The Pressures of Newlywed Bucket Lists</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/happy-opportunities/>Happy Opportunities</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/10-tips-for-going-through-fertility-treatments/>10 Tips for Going Through Fertility Treatments</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/christmas-card-to-your-spouse/>Christmas Card to Your Spouse!</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/we-wash-you-a-happy-holiday/>We Wash You A Happy Holiday!</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/25-white-elephant-gift-ideas/>25 White Elephant Gift Ideas</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/50-gift-ideas-for-your-spouse/>50 Gift Ideas for Your Spouse</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/3-tips-for-preventing-holiday-stress-from-affecting-your-marriage/>3 Tips For Preventing Holiday Stress From Affecting Your Marriage</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/back-to-school-interview-for-your-spouse/>Back to School Interview For Your Spouse</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-26/>A Joyful Marriage - Week 26</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/4-reasons-you-should-write-a-will-how-to-do-that/>4 Reasons You Should Write a Will & How to do it</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-22/>A Joyful Marriage - Week 22</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.com>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
