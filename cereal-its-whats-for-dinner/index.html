I thought we were pretty great at this, and wouldn&rsquo;t struggle with it as much as we have been lately. It&rsquo;s something that I thought I might have a hard time with when we have kids, but nope. It&rsquo;s already a struggle at 9 months of marriage.</p><h4 id=what-is-this-problem-you-ask>What is this problem, you ask?</h4><p>Meals. Yeah I thought you might laugh. It does seem like a first world problem, but it&rsquo;s a dilemma I face three times a day, and this is why:</p><p>When Trevor and I first started making meals together, while we were engaged, we got into a nice groove of some great dishes that we both enjoyed, we were pro at making, or that were inexpensive. For whatever reasons of why we enjoyed them and made them often, we had a nice list started, and didn&rsquo;t seem to run out of ideas on what to make. Then when we got married, those meals were improved, and other new recipes were added to the list. But now, it seems like we are getting tired of the same old meals. I&rsquo;m sure this is inevitable part of being a wife or mother.</p><p>It also doesn&rsquo;t help that I&rsquo;ve had some on-going medical issues the past two months, that have caused me to have certain food aversions that have gotten to be very annoying. And on top of that, I now have some restrictions on what I should be eating, which hover in the back of my mind every time I think about what to eat. My thoughts on a daily basis go like this: &ldquo;Great, that bowl of cereal I just had, contained a kajillion grams of carbs.&rdquo; or &ldquo;I had bread as part of my lunch, so I should rule out any dinner ideas that require rice or breads tonight.&rdquo; And: &ldquo;My once favorite salsa? Oh gosh, I think I&rsquo;m going to throw up just thinking about it.&rdquo; And then when I think I&rsquo;ve got the answer, I&rsquo;ll get a thought like this: &ldquo;Well gosh, this doesn&rsquo;t have vegetables in it, and we haven&rsquo;t had any today.&rdquo;  It&rsquo;s like having this giant pinterest board of meal options, that gets cut in half with each restricting thought. It&rsquo;s frustrating. This is the point where a bowl of cereal starts looking real good.</p><p>Trevor is soooooooooo patient with me through all of this, with an emphasis on &ldquo;sooooooooooo.&rdquo; He is not a picky eater in the first place, and then he&rsquo;s so cooperative and understanding with my daily changing cravings, or lack thereof. It gets to the point where he just lets me choose what we have for dinner and he will eat whatever it is. What a trooper. I tell him every day how I appreciate his understanding and patience with me through this. I&rsquo;ll say it again Trevor, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry for my annoying food issues!&rdquo; I feel bad that my pickiness, lack of great cooking skills, and current situations affect him, and affect my role as a wife.</p><h4 id=whats-the-solution>What&rsquo;s the solution?</h4><p>So I guess you could say, we are in a food &ldquo;rut&rdquo;, even aside from the things going on with me. Again, I realize that this is a first world problem, because we have food that we can afford to buy, but it is a big thing weighing on our minds recently. Because again, it&rsquo;s a decision we make three times a day. We need ideas of how to mix things up or try new meals, and pinterest and cookbooks are only getting us so far. I&rsquo;ve been working hard on finding some new meals, as well as trying to get over my picky habits, and I will continue to work on it. If anyone has ideas, let us know. Hopefully the next time I bring up this subject, I&rsquo;ll have some tips for those of you in a similar situation like us. However long it takes, I know it will be a way that I can freshen up my marriage!</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/all class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">all</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/funny class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">funny</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/journal class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">journal</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/national-old-stuff-day/>National Old Stuff Day</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/dentist-dilemma/>Dentist Dilemma</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/preparing-for-the-zombie-apocalypse/>Preparing For The Zombie Apocalypse</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/note-to-self/>Note To Self</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/the-iron-2/>The Iron</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/365-date-night-ideas/>365 Date Night Ideas</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/happy-opportunities/>Happy Opportunities</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/of-things-that-matter-most/>Of Things That Matter Most</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/quiet-love/>Quiet Love</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/married-at-22-and-proud-of-it/>Married at 22, And Proud of It</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/365-days-of-love/>365 Days of Love</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/yinyang/>The Yin and Yang Of Marriage</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/traditions/>A Traditional Christmas</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/lets-commemorate-something/>Six Month Anniversary - Let's Commemorate Something</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/you-are-the-most-beautiful-creature/>You Are The Most Beautiful Creature On Planet Earth</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.github.io>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
