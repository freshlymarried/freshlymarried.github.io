It was fun taking the time to put together our house because there&rsquo;s no way I would&rsquo;ve had time to do it all in the beginning, and there&rsquo;s no way we would&rsquo;ve had all the money to spend on everything in the beginning. Making our house our own was an empowering feeling but also a comforting feeling. There haven&rsquo;t been walls to share with other people and no landlords giving us rules for how to decorate. Going through this whole process has helped us not only see physically, but feel mentally the transition between a house becoming a home :)</p><p>Our childhood homes weren&rsquo;t always safe havens so in starting our own family, Trevor and I wanted to always maintain a feeling of safety and peace wherever we lived. What a blessing it has been to feel that in a place of our own, where we can get away from the challenges or negativity that can be waiting for us just outside our front door. I felt that when we were living in apartments, but this brings a new level of stability in our lives that we have been very satisfied with.</p><p><a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_0626.jpg><img src=/images/IMG_0626.jpg alt=IMG_0626></a></p><p><a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_0654.jpg><img src=/images/IMG_0654.jpg alt=IMG_0654></a></p><p><a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_0707.jpg><img src=/images/IMG_0707.jpg alt=IMG_0707></a></p><p><a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_0074.jpg><img src=/images/IMG_0074.jpg alt=IMG_0074></a></p><p><a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_0052.jpg><img src=/images/IMG_0052.jpg alt=IMG_0052></a></p><p><img src=/images/IMG_0047.jpg alt=IMG_0047></p><p><a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_0342.jpg><img src=/images/IMG_0342.jpg alt=IMG_0342></a></p><h4 id=things-we-learned-from-the-first-year-in-our-home>Things we learned from the first year in our home:</h4><ul><li>We are homebodies at heart! We get more homesick being away for a few days because we appreciate our own comfy space.</li><li>How much I love baking :) I&rsquo;ve even felt more desire to cook new recipes.</li><li>Having separate creative spaces is good for us! We were initially sharing one of the extra bedrooms for trevor&rsquo;s office and my office/craft room. We realized how opposite we were with organization and creative space (haha, can you guess who is the constant messy one?!) and felt it would be best to just utilize the other extra bedroom while we have it and separate our offices. Great decision for our sanity and creativity :)</li><li>A house requires a lot of maintenance and understanding! We were thrown into learning the breaker system, water heater, air filtration, sprinkler system, water valves, etc. Some of these things we learned the hard way to handle, haha. Why do you think Trevor took so many pictures of steps so we don&rsquo;t forget??  (Thanks for doing that Trev!)</li></ul><p><a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/zones-and-schedule.jpg><img src=/images/zones-and-schedule-300x217.jpg alt=zones-and-schedule></a></p><p>The biggest thing we have learned, however, is what matters most. We chose to have a house over other things, so we have learned to prioritize our needs and wants - buying home decor, shopping, entertaining, traveling, having new cars. Our budgeting plan went through transformations that are working great for us, and we have been happy with all that we have. Sometimes you don&rsquo;t need to travel the world and stay in crappy motels when you can stay in a familiar, comfortable, and cozy place and enjoy other entertainment. We felt that the best investment for us was not saving up for a vacation that would last 5 days, but a house where we spend most of our lives in.</p><h4 id=let-the-good-times-roll>Let the good times roll</h4><p>I&rsquo;m so grateful for all the memories we already have in this house! I look forward to many more porch afternoons, reclining on those comfy chairs listening to music and playing games against each other. I look forward to many more times falling asleep on our couch while watching TV (Even though it&rsquo;s annoying for Trevor sometimes). I look forward to many more times watering potted plants. I look forward to more sighs of relief when it&rsquo;s snowing and freezing cold but I remember how I get to pull into a warmer and dry garage instead of having to run through the snow. I look forward to learning how to fix more things around the house when they happen. I look forward to one day cuddling up to our kids while watching movies. And I look forward to painting many more surprises in our garage :)</p><p><a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_1420.jpg><img src=/images/IMG_1420.jpg alt=IMG_1420></a></p><p><a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_1367.jpg><img src=/images/IMG_1367.jpg alt=IMG_1367></a> <a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_00781.jpg></a><a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_1544.jpg><img src=/images/IMG_1544.jpg alt=IMG_1544></a></p><p><a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_2347.jpg><img src=/images/IMG_2347-e1453182736170.jpg alt=IMG_2347></a></p><p> </p><p><a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_3866.jpg><img src=/images/IMG_3866.jpg alt=IMG_3866></a></p><p><img src=/images/IMG_0078-1.jpg alt="marriage milestones, milestones in marriage, first home, newlywed home, first time home buyers, first house, buying a house, newlyweds,"></p><p> </p><p><a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/IMG_2632.jpg><img src=/images/IMG_2632.jpg alt=IMG_2632></a></p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/all class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">all</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/celebrate class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">celebrate</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/goals class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">goals</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/journal class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">journal</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/romance class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">romance</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/starting-our-second-year/>Starting Our Second Year</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/one-year/>One Year</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/married-at-22-and-proud-of-it/>Married at 22, And Proud of It</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/365-days-of-love/>365 Days of Love</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/why-an-associate-degree-is-a-big-deal-to-me/>Why An Associate Degree Is a Big Deal To Me</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/second-anniversary/>Second Anniversary</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/you-are-my-happy/>You Are My Happy</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/the-date-night-bucket-list/>The Date Night Bucket List</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/an-ok-cliche/>An OK Cliche</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/the-difference-a-picture-can-make/>The Difference a Picture Can Make</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/new-years-resolutions-married-style/>New Year's Resolutions: Married-Style</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/our-first-apartment/>Our First Apartment</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/our-house-story-part-2-you-can-learn-a-lot-in-four-days/>Our House Story Part 2: You Can Learn a Lot in Four Days</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/our-house-story-part-1-timing-is-everything/>Our House Story Part 1: Timing is Everything</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/home-is-insert-cliche-here/>Home is {insert cliche here}</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.github.io>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
