This is one of my favorite quotes, by one of my favorite people who ever lived. He says this quote above in his book, &ldquo;Standing For Something: 10 neglected virtues that will heal our hearts and homes.&rdquo; and I absolutely LOVE this book. I first read it about six years ago, and I still remember amazing points he brought up about society and families, and I find myself referring back to reading pieces often."><meta name=generator content="Hugo 0.101.0"><meta name=robots content="index, follow"><link rel=stylesheet href=/ananke/css/main.min.4db9b634643fd35508199f862a8657d2b3f3059bac767df55139f712e79f4de3.css><link rel="shortcut icon" href=/images/favicon.png type=image/x-icon><meta property="og:title" content="Love is Like The North Star"><meta property="og:description" content="This post contains affiliate links to Amazon.

Which means Freshly Married can make a small commission on items you buy through these links.</em></p><p>This is one of my favorite quotes, by one of my favorite people who ever lived. He says this quote above in his book, <a href=https://amzn.to/2H5rILv><em>&ldquo;Standing For Something: 10 neglected virtues that will heal our hearts and homes.&rdquo;</em></a> and I absolutely LOVE this book. I first read it about six years ago, and I still remember amazing points he brought up about society and families, and I find myself referring back to reading pieces often.</p><p>The reason why I love this quote is that it resonates so well with life and marriage. So far in my 25 years of age, I have DEFINITELY experienced sudden change, sometimes it is happening in every aspect of my life, even! Sometimes changes are good, but I typically have a hard time when my life shifts directions. I&rsquo;m sure we have all had experiences like this, and we remember how we felt during that time. It was probably a mixture of worry, stress, uncertainty, insecurity, and maybe even a little faith or comfort here and there. We know what creates the stressors, but do we know what made us feel the pockets of comfort? I bet it was LOVE :) Whether it was love from a family member, friend, random person, or significant other.  <strong>A strong foundational love has the power to bring faith and comfort to you in the midst of distress.</strong> </p><h1 id=he-is-my-north-star>He is my north star</h1><p>During the time Trevor and I have been together (about 3.5 years), I truly have found that <strong>he is my North Star</strong>. He&rsquo;s the constant in my changing world, especially when it feels like every aspect of my life is changing. His love for me and my love for him doesn&rsquo;t change. When I get turned around from the path of happiness and self-confidence, I look to him and he guides me back to it. He is my compass. The love we have between us is my compass. It&rsquo;s something that I can look at in the midst of all the chaos and know that it will still be there through all of the anxiety, pain, and fear.</p><p><strong>Having a strong love in marriage is such a beautiful safety net to me! It&rsquo;s the ULTIMATE safety net.</strong> Some marriages have built a love between them that has not come with that feeling of a safety net, for whatever reasons. It saddens me that they feel the need to find something else to be their constant, instead of their union. <strong>Marriages are made for being the constant in our ever-changing world.</strong> Marriages are supposed to be strong enough to be a guiding comfort. Try letting it be that again, if you have lost it. Keep working at gaining that safe feeling back!</p><p>I LOVE YOU TREVOR!
