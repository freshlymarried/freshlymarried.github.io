I saw a cute picture of a kid holding up one of those back to school/all about me interview papers that people tend to do with their kids every year. And I instantly had a contradicting thought: <em>&ldquo;Back to school interviews aren&rsquo;t just for kids!&rdquo;</em> haha. Which then inspired a great thought&mldr;</p><p><strong>How fun would it be to make a &ldquo;back to school&rdquo; interview for you and your spouse to answer for each semester of college?! Kids do it, so why not adults? I mean, the whole purpose of it is to create a journal of sorts on the thoughts and details of going to school. So why can&rsquo;t adults do that too?</strong></p><p>With it being that &ldquo;back to school&rdquo; time of year again, I think it&rsquo;s a perfect timing to share this idea with those of you who are going to college right now! Here are some questions I was thinking about that would be fun to answer as an adult going through college:</p><ul><li>The career they are working towards</li><li>Their favorite classes in the upcoming semester and least favorite classes.</li><li>What the hope to accomplish this semester</li><li>Their favorite places to study and do homework</li><li>Their favorite snacks or lunch to enjoy while in class</li><li>What spring/fall break vacations you have planned</li><li>The number of semesters left before they graduate</li><li>And their overall thoughts and feelings going into this new semester.</li></ul><hr><h3 id=back-to-school-interview-back-to-school-interview-for-adults-back-to-school-journaling-college-journaling-journaling-about-spouse-in-college-marriage-advice-marriage-help-fun-back-to-school-ideas-for-adults-imagesimg_1053jpg><img src=/images/IMG_1053.jpg alt="back to school interview, back to school interview for adults, back to school journaling, college journaling, journaling about spouse in college, marriage advice, marriage help, fun back to school ideas for adults, "></h3><h3 id=its-the-documentation-that-counts>It&rsquo;s the documentation that counts</h3><p>These questions might seem kind of bland, but I think it&rsquo;s important to journal these different thoughts down, especially if you do one every semester because you can see a potential transformation of excitement and progress! It&rsquo;s also fun to record those little details like the snacks and places to study.</p><p>For example, I had my preferences on where I liked to study and do homework when I went to Utah Valley University. It was in one of the newer buildings, on a specific floor, in a corner right next to all the big windows. I liked facing a certain way so that I wouldn&rsquo;t have distractions in my peripheral vision, and I liked being away from the restrooms because you could hear the toilets flush every time haha. My favorite snack to grab in the vending machines was a bag of gardettos!</p><p>It&rsquo;s fun to document these things, right? I wish that my husband and I would have done something like this when we were going to school still, whether we wrote it down, took a picture of us holding up our answers, or did a verbal video interview. Wouldn&rsquo;t that be fun to make it a video?!</p><p>If you like this idea, there&rsquo;s no need to write these questions down because I MADE A PRINTABLE FOR YOU!</p><p><a href=https://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Back-to-School-Interview-2.pdf><img src=/images/Back-to-School-Interview.png alt></a></p><hr><p>Other blog posts on being a married college student you might like:</p><ul><li><a href=https://freshlymarried.com/being-a-married-college-student/>&ldquo;Being a Married College Student&rdquo;</a></li><li><a href=https://freshlymarried.com/why-an-associate-degree-is-a-big-deal-to-me/>&ldquo;Why an Associate Degree is a Big Deal to me&rdquo;</a></li><li><a href=https://freshlymarried.com/the-thing-about-provo/>&ldquo;The Thing About Provo&rdquo;</a></li></ul><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/all class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">all</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/celebrate class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">celebrate</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/goals class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">goals</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/journal class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">journal</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/being-a-married-college-student/>Being a Married College Student</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/financial-independence/>Financial Independence</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/25-2/>25</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/a-smashing-valentines-day/>A Smashing Valentine's Day</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/the-pressures-of-newlywed-bucket-lists/>The Pressures of Newlywed Bucket Lists</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/our-first-year-being-homeowners/>Our First Year Being Homeowners</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/why-an-associate-degree-is-a-big-deal-to-me/>Why An Associate Degree Is a Big Deal To Me</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/new-years-resolutions-married-style/>New Year's Resolutions: Married-Style</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/our-first-apartment/>Our First Apartment</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/our-house-story-part-2-you-can-learn-a-lot-in-four-days/>Our House Story Part 2: You Can Learn a Lot in Four Days</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/our-house-story-part-1-timing-is-everything/>Our House Story Part 1: Timing is Everything</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/home-is-insert-cliche-here/>Home is {insert cliche here}</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/starting-our-second-year/>Starting Our Second Year</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/one-year/>One Year</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/happy-opportunities/>Happy Opportunities</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.github.io>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
