## What is this website about?

Freshly Married is a resource for anyone looking to strengthen their marriage! You’ll find helpful advice and new ideas to try whether you have been married for many years or just a few. Because ANY marriage can use a little freshener!

## How did it get started?

Freshly Married began shortly after I was married when I felt a need to provide more resources for couples looking to strengthen their marriage, especially for newlyweds. So I started blogging about our experiences and the growing knowledge I was gaining while going to school to become a Relationship Specialist!

## What does 'Freshly Married' mean?

Some people think it means someone who very recently got married, like a newlywed. Yes, that’s true, but I have taken it to a deeper meaning - That any couple no matter how many years they have been together, can make daily changes that keep their marriage lively and fresh :) I have written [a post which explains more about this philosophy](/what-it-means-to-be-freshly-married).

## The wife behind Freshly Married

I am a Family Life Educator teaching couples how to strengthen their marriage and keep it fresh through helpful advice, support, ideas, and inspiration!

I am a member of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/comeuntochrist), and this faith is a big part of my marriage!

I love spending time with my husband because he’s kind of great! I try to look for the good in each day, especially with finding little events to celebrate with Sparkling Cider!

## What qualifies me to give marriage advice?

I'm continually on the same journey to keep my marriage fresh, too! I believe sharing experiences helps us be more relatable to each other, but I also think it’s important to share sound advice because marriage is a big deal. Soooo I love sharing crucial information from top marriage experts, but I also have learned a lot through the following credentials:

- Bachelor of Arts in Behavioral Sciences, emphasis in Family Studies
- PREP Trained Leader (Preventative Relationship Enhancement Program for married and committed relationships)
- Certified Instructor with Family Wellness Associates, specializing in the _"Survival Skills for Healthy Families"_, _"The Strongest Link: The Couple"_, and _"Map for Marriage: Before You Say I do"_ curriculums
- P.I.C.K a Partner Program certified instructor with Love Thinks, based on the book _"How to Avoid Falling in Love With a Jerk"_ by John Van Epp.
