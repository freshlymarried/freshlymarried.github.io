## The joy I found in my marriage this week: thoughtful surprises!

In the past few weeks, a few situations have come up that make me look back on everything it took to get where we are now. We both had to go through a lot of learning and heartbreak before meeting each other, and being ready for each other. Even though you have a few tough minutes of remembering those hard times, it all makes you appreciate your relationship for what it is today, ya know? It helps you not take it for granted, and to be more intentional in everything you do.

Trevor's intentions this week were to surprise me, despite him fighting a horrible cold! On the morning of Valentine's Day, I went to pick up our groceries and Trevor said he would have a surprise waiting for me when I got home :) I didn't know there would be a mural waiting for me when I pulled into the garage!

We never painted our garage when we first moved in, so these blank walls became a canvas to paint stuff on :) A few months after we moved into our house I randomly painted some lyrics up on the main garage wall for Trevor before he came home from work (you can see the full lyrics and post [here](http://freshlymarried.com/our-first-year-being-homeowners/)). And two years later he did the same little gesture for me :) BUT he was more amazing and not only wrote the message specifically towards me, but he also wrote down some of his favorite things he loves about me in between! :) Some of the things it said were: "you have a contagious laugh" and "you sing and dance like no one is watching." haha. yep that's me.

I am grateful that every day when I get in or out of my car, I can see this special message, and be reminded that I am loved; that I have some great qualities that contribute to our marriage and to life. But mostly a reminder that I have a wonderful and thoughtful husband. :)
