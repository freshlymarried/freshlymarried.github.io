The past three weeks, Trevor and I have felt like we've been bums, couch potatoes, or whatever you call it. I am just finishing a cold I have had for the past 3 weeks, so I haven't had much energy to workout, or do extra things beyond the necessary chores. I've mostly been tired, while Trevor has also been tired from some adjustments in his new job. While he loves it, his brain can be on overload sometimes. So most nights when we get home from work, we have just laid on the couch and watched our favorite TV shows. The funny/sad thing about this, is that we started a new television series on Netflix about the same time I got sick, and we're already half way done with the third season... haha wow. We are bums. It's fine.

There are some times when I feel guilty for just watching TV, instead of doing more productive things. However, this time, I haven't really felt that way. We've had a lot go on in our lives recently -- some good changes and exciting things, but also some stressful things. I can't blame myself for wanting to step away from all of that for a little while. And who's to say that letting my mind escape and relax from the stresses of life is not productive?!

#### Reasons to be a couch potato sometimes

I think we should all be a couch potato every once in awhile. Our lives are filled with things to do, and most of them seem to have a deadline attached. Do you make sure to take a break from that? (Or in our case, a lot of breaks haha). I seem to always have a to-do list, and sometimes those unfinished tasks haunt me when I'm falling asleep at night, so It has been nice to say "Oh well" to those lists. We still go on walks to enjoy the weather and get some exercise in, we still have kept our apartment clean, we still run those errands we need to, and we still try to be social. However, I think it's important to give ourselves some TLC sometimes, so that's what we have done. And that is my long list of reasons to justify being a bum lately! :)

Sunday Fact: It appears Trevor has caught the same cold I had... poor kid. Looks like we may have another few weeks of being bums ;)
