Every anniversary we do a little something to celebrate our love! Like everyone else! haha. Some people choose to follow the theme of their year from that list of anniversary gifts [here](http://ideas.hallmark.com/anniversary-ideas/anniversary-gifts-by-year/). I guess I don't want to be told what to get my spouse because my spouse is unique! Our gift to each other was celebrating in Hawaii this year, but I wanted us to do something special there to mark the occasion. I packed a glass corked bottle and some paper with us, and we made our very own message in a bottle for someone to find :) Probably was someone on the beach with us that night because I'm guessing the waves brought it back to shore, quicker than we planned haha. ANYWAYS it was the thought that counts! I put together a video of that so enjoy!
