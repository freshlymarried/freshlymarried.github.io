We all know that being kind can change someone's entire day around, or maybe someone's act of kindness has changed YOUR entire day. Kindness is so powerful, if you didn't know that already! Throughout my marriage I've definitely been shown and taught how powerful it can be.

When Trevor and I first experienced tiffs with each other, our process of being upset and also working through it was something new to me. When we were frustrated at each other, I didn't expect him to speak so softly to me. And even after we've talked further and understood each other better, I wasn't expecting him to say, "What can I do better?" or "What can I do for you?" That's kind of hard to do when you might still have lingering feelings of frustration! But he has done that to me multiple times and it's changed how I respond, and it helps me put my own pride aside.

## Kindness is a game-changer

Unexpected kindness in our marriages has the power to turn a difficult topic into a more manageable topic, a spouse's bad mood into a better one, and turn a bad day into a good day :) **I believe that kindness in our marriages, especially during the difficult times, can get through to those spouses that don't want to listen and don't want to see.** It can soften the hard of hearts. Because just like this quote reminds us, kindness doesn't go unrecognized.

We are not always kind to each other sadly, because we are not perfect! But we like the idea of kindness so much we joke to each other a lot  about it. When one of us teases the other, we'll say: "be kind please!" haha. It reminds me of that slogan for movie rentals: "BE KIND, REWIND PLEASE" Hahaha. I'm telling you, I'm going to make a sign in our house that says that when we have kids. It will be great. Anyways, kindness is important. do it. :)
