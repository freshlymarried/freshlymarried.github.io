Social media can make it seem like our marriages aren't fun or entertaining enough, as if the time we do get with each other doesn't matter if it wasn't elaborate, if it wasn't longer than an hour, or if the weekend was spent inside even though it's beautiful outside. It's easy to feel like that when your life is busy, or if there is something lacking in your relationship.

My friend and Mr. Whitman here reminded me that the activity couples do isn't as important as the fact that they are trying to spend quality time together. I'm not saying settle for the same activity every weekend, or to stop trying to do something special. But instead, just be happy to have the time you do in those moments of busy life.

This is something good to remember this holiday weekend and as the regular busy schedules come back in full swing!
