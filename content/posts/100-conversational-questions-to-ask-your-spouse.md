## We've all been there

You're on a much-needed date night out, away from work, home, and the kids (if you have them). Whatever the activity you're doing, there is time for conversations to happen and somehow the conversation ends up being any or all of the following scenarios:

- Talking too much business stuff - the kids’ schedules, work stress, etc.
- Not knowing what to talk about, especially if you think you know everything about each other already
- Bringing up issues that start an argument

I think we’ve all found ourselves in one of these situations on our date nights before. And it’s taught us that...

I’ve shared in previous blog posts like, [“The Importance of Fun,"](https://freshlymarried.com/the-importance-of-fun/) how I have made mistakes in the past of bringing up business stuff like chores and the to-do list, and how it has dampened the fun of our dates. **It helped me realize how important it is to keep this time focused on having fun with each other, getting away from the stresses of life, and strengthening our emotional intimacy.**

## Questions ideal for married couples

Date night conversations should be light-hearted, positive, engaging, and focused on the present. And one of the best ways people try to accomplish this is through asking each other questions. Just when you think, “I don’t know what to ask my spouse because I already know pretty much everything about them!” THINK AGAIN!

If you’re like me and my husband, you have searched online for different questions to ask your spouse while at dinner. We have asked each other questions from a few different resources, but I’ll be honest, I haven’t found a single resource for questions that are ideal for married couples. What I mean is that **married couples need questions that meet the following criteria: 1) the questions go beyond the basics that we should already know because those conversations can get dull and 2) they avoid questions that are too serious for date night because they have the potential to cause an argument.**

So Trevor suggested that I write a blog post of my own consisting of great conversational questions that were light-hearted and engaging! Ones that are perfect for married couples to ask on date night, road trips, or during any other quality time spent together! So here are 100 different questions you can ask your spouse while you're just sitting there waiting for your food to come!
