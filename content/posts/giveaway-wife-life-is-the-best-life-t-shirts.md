\*\*\*GIVEAWAY HAS ENDED, WINNERS ANNOUNCED AT THE END OF THE POST\*\*\*

Since summer is officially over, I wanted to cheer us up with a giveaway! **I am giving away TWO of my "Wife Life is The Best Life" t-shirts!**Â Woot woot! We know ya'll want to rock this shirt right now. ESPECIALLY all those newlyweds who just got married this summer ;) You get to choose between these two shirt styles [here](https://www.etsy.com/shop/FreshlyMarried?ref=hdr_shop_menu).

I love this phrase because for me, I do feel blessed being a wife. It's rewarding getting to serve someone and they serve you back. It has very tough moments occasionally, but those moments make the sweet moments feel more deeply fulfilling than any other relationship I have experienced so far :) I know many wives out there feel the same, so I want you guys to have this shirt to show your pride!

HOW TO ENTER:

- Comment on this blog post sharing one thing you love about being a spouse! (Yes that means that husbands can totally enter and win this for their wives!)
- If you have multiple things you love about being a spouse, then write as many comments as you want, because each one gives you another entry :)
- THAT'S IT.
