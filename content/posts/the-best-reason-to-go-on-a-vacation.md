For the last year, we have been looking into a big vacation for ourselves. We've done research to various places, planning, and multiple times were minutes away from actually booking a trip! Yet we haven't pulled the trigger... until now! We finally did it - we went to HAWAII! Some of you might be saying, "Going to Hawaii is this big for you guys?" or "We go on vacations all the time..." Well, it's different for us, and because it's not something we do often, it will be that much more special :)

The reasons why it took us forever is because I have a hard time making decisionsÂ and because we are very practical people. Trevor and I don't like spending money on something that doesn't seem worth the cost. We also like to feel secure about a big purchase knowing that we can pay for a fun trip but also have something aside for emergencies. For some reason, each trip we planned I never felt 100% about.

#### The best reason to go

There will always be reasons not to go, as I can attest to! Sometimes very smart reasons not to go. And sometimes there are really smart reasons why you should go! Just to name a few: we have actually never been on a big trip just the two of us (big trip categorized as flying on an airplane) because we chose to do a honeymoon closer to home. It's a usual part of life for couples that we haven't experienced together and that's exciting to us! These reasons were there before, but more "worth it" reasons seem to come to me like an epiphany after all this time.

I think we just realized we needed something different right now. We needed a new romantic adventure to experience together, especially before kids start coming. It's sad that it takes a kick in the pants sometimes to help you see what you need, but I'm grateful for it, anyways. **Knowing that going on a romantic vacation just the two of us can benefit my marriage right now makes the cost SOOOO worth it!**

#### Make it work

I'm not saying go on an expensive trip if you don't have the money for it. And I'm not saying that going on a vacation will fix a struggling area in your marriage. But if you are feeling the need for a getaway, do something within your means, no matter how little, like doing a weekend staycation without the kids. I'm glad that we didn't just go on a vacation because we could. I'm glad we are going on this vacation because we genuinely want to, we will genuinely enjoy it, and because it's important to our marriage that we do!

I'm looking forward to sharing our experience, and pictures now that we are back! Especially because every getaway we have been on that has been at least 4+ hours away, I have orchestrated something special :) Our [one year anniversary](http://freshlymarried.com/one-year/) stay in the Tetons, we took a private hot air balloon ride! Last May we ["locked our love"](http://freshlymarried.com/lock-your-love-part-1/) in St. George at the "lock your love" gate, then on New Year's day of this year we went back to see it :) Sooo I planned something special to do in Hawaii for our third anniversary and it's cute :) Until I share all that, enjoy this one epic picture of our fav Hawaii sunset we enjoyed after dinner on our anniversary :)
