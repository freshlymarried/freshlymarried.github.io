I had a good luck charm apparently for this St. Patricks Day because I "won" some amazing seats to the Jazz game that night! I say "won" because an old friend couldn't use them so they did a little drawing for people interested and I got them :) What's better than a fun date night to an NBA game? A FREE ONE, haha. It was double-y awesome because Trevor and I had never been to a game together yet. So we got something checked off our bucket list!
