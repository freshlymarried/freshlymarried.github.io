After about a month of plotting, pinteresting, sketching, researching, purchasing, ironing, cutting, pinning, sewing, unpicking, and sewing again, I FINISHED MY HUSBAND'S QUILT! It turned out so well, and best of all, he loved it and appreciated it so much when I surprised him with it!

### WHY

Last year my MIL made me a beautiful triangle quilt, and it's been so comfy and matches our color scheme so well! I've been wanting Trev to have a specially-made blanket as well. One that is the material, thickness, and print he prefers that gives him just the right amount of comfort :) Even though I was a little nervous that it had been awhile since I had made any blankets or quilts,  I was also excited because I wanted to be the one to do this for him :)

### WHAT I LEARNED

**This process taught me about our imperfections and how it relates to marriage.** Throughout the making of it, there were several times I had to re-do some stitching, for whatever reason. I think one time I wasn't paying enough attention and stitched the wrong pieces together, or didn't lay them on their correct sides, haha. And there were times where my stitching was so crazy that I worried someone would look at it up close and be very unimpressed!

This quilt reflects my marriage so nicely, as well as marriage in general. The stitching is so skewed, the cutting wasn't totally squared up, and the rows aren't all equal size! **My husband saw those mistakes and imperfections, yet he loved and accepted it (me) anyways.** He saw how amazing the quilt was as a whole instead of solely focusing on the tiny details in specific areas. He has seen and acknowledged my efforts in trying to fix those little imperfections and appreciates me for it. He doesn't nit-pick at the little things I do that aren't up to par. And after all of it, he still looks forward to snuggling with me every night in that quilt, getting to hold him close, keeping him warm, and comforting him.

#### My TWO TAKEAWAYS

1. Mistakes, whether large or small, will be a part of the rest of our lives, just like this blanket will be used and seen almost every day for years to come. But just because those shortcomings happened, it doesn't mean we need to dwell on them. We all can work better at forgiving our spouse's shortcomings and mistakes.
2. Just like how the quilt is not the best quality of work compared to other quilts, maybe your marriage doesn't look or feel as pretty as another's marriage. You might worry what people think, but the only opinion that matters is your spouse's. Focus on making your marriage look and feel pretty to just the two of you, not to anyone else.

I think these are on-going struggles we as couples will have as long as we are married, haha. Which is why I'm grateful to have this quilt because it's kind of poetic that every night we get to be wrapped up in something that reminds us of this lesson and reminder :)
