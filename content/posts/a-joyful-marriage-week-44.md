**I like to think my DIY skills and creativity bless our marriage for the better :)** If we’re talking about it bringing joy to my marriage, it sure does because I fully enjoy doing little thoughtful surprises/projects like this one I did for hubby this week.

We have this thing called “ultimate couch bed” that we like to do periodically throughout the year. Particularly when there are some movie marathons of tv show binge watching or someone is sick and we know we will be on the couch all weekend :) It's where we rearrange our couch sectional pieces in the living room to form one giant couch right in front of the TV.

In the past, I've just hung up old bed sheets from the ceiling above, but a few weeks ago I decided I should just get a more legit bed canopy over it so it would be easier. THEN I saw their prices and all the piece I had to assemble it and figured that I could just do the same thing for half the cost and it can be customized. So I did :)

I took two new flat sheets I bought in colors I thought looked fun and matched our house similarly and secured them in a big embroidery hoop. (Extra wifey points because it's one of my husband's favorite colors!) Before tightening the hoop, I laced through it 3 pieces of elastic ribbon so that I could hang it from the ceiling fan a little easier. I had to tape the back opening down a bit because it kept caving in, but not a bad little adjustment. The hardest part of this project: ironing out all the creases in the sheets so it looked nicer. OK, NOT ALLLLLL OF THE CREASES, haha but much better than it looked out of the package!

My husband enjoyed this for the next few days while we watched all of Stranger Things 2! The dark tent-like environment I created added to the experience of watching it :)

There are several other examples of when I have done little DIY things for him or for us, and I just love doing every single one of them! The best part is he enjoys them too, even if sometimes it would have been easier to just buy rather than make. Like [this quilt that I made](https://freshlymarried.com/object-lessons-an-imperfect-quilt/) for him that had obvious mistakes on it from this amateur sewer! **I'm not sharing this to say, "Look I'm a thoughtful and creative wife!" I'm saying this like, "Hey Amy, you are a pretty good wife, and you have talents that make your marriage brighter. It's important for you to acknowledge that every so often."** :) I hope you notice your own talents that contribute to the joy in your marriage!
