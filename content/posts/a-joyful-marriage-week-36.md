**This joy is going to AGAIN sound familiar... trying new things together, or just things that we grew up doing but haven't done since we've been together.**

We went to a little Idaho getaway with family this weekend and had a blast doing a whole bunch of outdoorsy adventurous things we haven't yet experienced together, like riding on four-wheelers,fishing and shooting. It's weird that in our 5 years of being together, 4 years of that in marriage, we haven't done these things yet, even though both of our families are outdoor sports adventurists. Whatever it took to get us here, we had fun, and that's all that matters, right?

I didn't realize how good Trevor was at shotgun shooting (clay pigeons) and how well he remembered, though it's been 8 years since he last did that. It's fun to experience those things together that we did individually growing up. Especially when we can teach each other how to do something.

This was a great reminder that we can continue to learn new things we didn't know about each other, and also that each spouse has skills and knowledge that we can continue to share with one another.

As you can tell on my husband's silly facial expression, it brought joy to us this week. :)
