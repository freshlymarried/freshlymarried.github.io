A quality in our marriage that brings me joy is our ability to count our blessings.

We are good at that. And I don't mean that in the literal counting sense, as if we are keeping track and pouting if we didn't have as many as we did last month, lol. I just meant that in a way that we can find a positive spin to situations, or find things to be thankful for, even amidst times of trials. Especially right now trying to have kids, because that can bring a feeling like something is missing. And I’m just proud that even though we may be feeling that at times right now, we still see so many things that _do_ fill our lives.

Having this sense of gratitude is what can keep you going. Realizing that you have been given and accomplished so much helps you appreciate it much more, and it makes you feel content about life. That's the state of joy I am feeling right now :)

## Happy Thanksgiving week!
