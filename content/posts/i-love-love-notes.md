### Amy and I can be a little goofy at times...

Actually, pretty much all the time :)

One of the goofy things we do is call each other "mine." I came home to a note on the table today that said "mine."

I love my wife. I am very thankful for the nice little notes that she leaves me around our apartment, on our bathroom mirror, on the fridge, through text messages, and through voicemails.

The small things really do make all the difference!

Keepin' gratitude fresh, Trevor
