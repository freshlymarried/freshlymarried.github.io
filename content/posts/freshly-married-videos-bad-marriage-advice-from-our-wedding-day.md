I was feeling like I needed to be doing videos as another form of helping couples strengthen their marriage because we all learn in different ways.I think this is also a great opportunity for my personality to come out a little more, which can help our relationship feel more personable :) I'm all about relating to others because it allows you to better understand them and trust them. So I hope my videos can help you further understand me, where I'm coming from, and trust my expertise.For my first video, I wanted to do something fun but also enlightening! At our wedding reception three years ago, we had our guests write down marriage advice to us on little cards that we have held onto all this time. I went through those cards, pondered over them, and found that some of the advice we were told wasn't good advice! So I'm sharing these pieces of advice and WHY I believe they don't work!
