### Hi, Freshly Married friends!

You probably noticed that we have been gone for a while. Yes, we were with family. Yes, we were partying it up with Christmas and the New Year and what not...but we were also working on this amazingly awesome new website! Wooo hooo! We hope you like it.

Along with the website updates, we created a new email list and social media accounts. Basically, to sum everything up, we are trying to make Freshly Married a better resource to help strengthen marriages. However, Amy and I can't do it alone...we need your help! You would be one awesome possum if you join the new Freshly Married newsletter and social media accounts:
