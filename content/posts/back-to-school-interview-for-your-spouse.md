Back to School InterviewThis is inspired by an email newsletter I received titled, _"Interviews aren't just for adults,"_ where I saw a cute picture of a kid holding up one of those back to school/all about me interview papers that people tend to do with their kids every year. And I instantly had a contradicting thought: _"Back to school interviews aren't just for kids!"_ haha. Which then inspired a great thought...

**How fun would it be to make a "back to school" interview for you and your spouse to answer for each semester of college?! Kids do it, so why not adults? I mean, the whole purpose of it is to create a journal of sorts on the thoughts and details of going to school. So why can't adults do that too?**

With it being that "back to school" time of year again, I think it's a perfect timing to share this idea with those of you who are going to college right now! Here are some questions I was thinking about that would be fun to answer as an adult going through college:

- The career they are working towards
- Their favorite classes in the upcoming semester and least favorite classes.
- What the hope to accomplish this semester
- Their favorite places to study and do homework
- Their favorite snacks or lunch to enjoy while in class
- What spring/fall break vacations you have planned
- The number of semesters left before they graduate
- And their overall thoughts and feelings going into this new semester.

### It's the documentation that counts

These questions might seem kind of bland, but I think it's important to journal these different thoughts down, especially if you do one every semester because you can see a potential transformation of excitement and progress! It's also fun to record those little details like the snacks and places to study.

For example, I had my preferences on where I liked to study and do homework when I went to Utah Valley University. It was in one of the newer buildings, on a specific floor, in a corner right next to all the big windows. I liked facing a certain way so that I wouldn't have distractions in my peripheral vision, and I liked being away from the restrooms because you could hear the toilets flush every time haha. My favorite snack to grab in the vending machines was a bag of gardettos!

It's fun to document these things, right? I wish that my husband and I would have done something like this when we were going to school still, whether we wrote it down, took a picture of us holding up our answers, or did a verbal video interview. Wouldn't that be fun to make it a video?!

If you like this idea, there's no need to write these questions down because I MADE A PRINTABLE FOR YOU!
