\*\*\*GIVEAWAY CLOSED\*\*\*

Many of our summer nights lately have consisted of take-out dinner. Somehow it's mostly Mexican food, too, which means Cafe Rio :) We like going to the restaurant itself occasionally but sometimes we are just too pooped from the day, and just want to eat it at home while we watch Monk :) Know what I'm saying?! There's been a big question apparently of what the masses prefer: their new Spicy Green Chile Pork, or their classic Sweet Pork.  You can tell from the pictures which one we chose. YUM! (Except for it's not as spicy as they advertise, and I'm even super sensitive to heat right now. It's mostly just got a great flavor to it). Some would say it's nice to try something new :)
