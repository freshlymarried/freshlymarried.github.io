## The joy I found in my marriage this week: being reminded of all the family and friends cheering us on.

* * *

I received two loving reminders this week:

1. I've shared here and there that we're concerned about trying to have kids. I'll share more on that in another blog post, but basically, the last two weeks the situation we are in has been on the forefront of our minds. The unknown has been worrisome for us, but a text message I received from my mother-in-law this week expressed lots of love letting us know that the family is very supportive and comforting. :)

1. I was flipping through pages of my mom's [soup cookbook](https://www.amazon.com/Soups-Valerie-Phillips/dp/162108129X/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1487994379&sr=8-3&keywords=valerie+phillips) (Yep, my mom's pretty cool to have her own cookbook), looking for new soups to try out. She gave us our own copy when we got married, and as I was flipping through, I saw the title page where she wrote her little dedication to us.

![soup's on, cookbook, soup's on cookbook, a joyful marriage, finding joy in marriage, finding joy, marriage advice, positive marriage, a positive marriage, positive marriage examples, marriage goals, relationship goals, newlywed goals, newlywed life, newlywed advice, newlywed help, lds newlyweds, lds marriage, lds marriage advice, marriage campaign](/images/IMG_0425.jpg)

The words may not be the most profound thing we've ever heard, haha, but the meaning behind it still came across that our family cares about our union, and they want it to succeed.

### Don't take it for granted

It might seem like a silly thing to feel grateful for because most of us are used to family members being supportive of each other's marriages. It feels common sense, right? Well, I mentioned in a recent blog post about [handling disapproving parents](http://freshlymarried.com/disapproving-parents-how-to-handle-it-and-why-you-should-do-that-now/), that having fully loving and supportive parents of you and your spouse is not easily to come by for some people.

Which is why I'm grateful that I have written mementos like this inscription or a text message, to remind me for a few minutes how loved Trevor and I are.It means so much lately when our parents have told us they are praying for us. Even if we aren't going through a hard time, knowing that people are thinking of you feels comforting. I don't want to take it for granted.

We get to be in the presence of parents and siblings in committed relationships who are doing their best to love and honor each other every day. None of us have the perfect relationships but I've noticed that each marriage has admirable qualities that the rest of us can aspire to have in our own marriage.

I hope you'll take a few minutes to think about the admirable qualities in the marriages in your close circles of family and friends. Think about what you can learn from them and what qualities they might find admirable in your relationship. I encourage you to express love and support to them, because you know how much it means to you :)
