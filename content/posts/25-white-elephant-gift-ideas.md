**What’s a “White Elephant” gift? It’s a silly gag gift usually for playing a White Elephant game!**

**How does it work?** There's a pile of gifts, one per person who is playing. Everyone draws a number which decides the order they choose a gift from the pile. If you have 13 people/13 gifts, you’ll have numbers 1-13 to draw from. Starting with person #1, they will choose a gift from the pile to unwrap and reveal to everyone. Person #2 can either steal that gift or unwrap a different gift from the pile. If person #2 steals from person #1, then person #1 gets to unwrap a gift from the pile. This continues on until each person has had a chance to steal a gift or unwrap a gift.

You can put other rules on it like: 1) if a person has their gift stolen from them, they have a chance to steal from another person, instead of always having to choose from the pile. 2) You limit the number of times a gift can be stolen. 3) Whatever gift you receive you have to display it in your house somewhere for the month of January. 4) if it’s an item of clothing you have to put it on for everyone to see!

As you can tell, it gets pretty funny depending on the kind of gifts people bring. My husband and I LOVE finding fun white elephant gifts each Christmas! And because both of our families started doing this tradition, we get to choose 4 total silly and fun gifts each Christmas! **Needless to say, we’ve spent lots of time researching and browsing silly and fun gift ideas. So the thought occurred to me that I should compile a list of some really good ones we have found for anyone else who likes to do this tradition with their families or for a holiday party. So here ya go! _(Most of these range between $5-$19!)_**

#### A fun side note

We have also had such good laughs over prank boxes! I think it's the most funny when you are giving someone a legitimate gift and you need to wrap it in a box. Because WHY NOT pay a few dollars more to put it in a hilarious box they get confused about thinking it's a real product?! Some of our favs:
