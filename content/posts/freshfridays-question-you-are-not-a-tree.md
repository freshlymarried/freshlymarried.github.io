I love this. Great advice for life but even better advice for marriage. **If your marriage is in a "rut" you don't have to settle for that stage.** You both have the power to make the changes that will put you in a stage you feel happy with. Whether it's making sacrifices, behavioral changes, or getting more outside help, you can make it happen. Think about that as you answer the #freshfridays question: "What change can you make TODAY to freshen up your marriage?"
