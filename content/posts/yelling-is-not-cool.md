### Story time

When we were living in an apartment still, there was a new family that moved in below us; a wife, husband, and a few kids. Since they moved in, almost every day we heard them yelling. The parents would yell at each other, the parents yelled at the kids, and the kids yelled at the parents. I absolutely hated it; I cringed every time. Yes, I cringed because it is annoying, but mainly because it shows that they are were not loving each other and instead were hurting each other. It makes me sad. It is one of the few things in life that I despise.

### Why is yelling not cool?

Yelling is definitely not cool. Why? Because yelling shows immaturity. Yelling says to the world, "I don't know how to control myself or my emotions". It is taking out frustrations by verbally abusing someone else. We wouldn't allow someone to physically abuse another person or child, so why do we tolerate verbal abuse? Yelling can cause permanent emotional and mental damage to our spouses and children. It can make them fearful and can hurt their ability to love themselves. It can hurt their trust in you.

I am not suggesting we shouldn't get in fights with our spouse or family, or that we shouldn't have frustrations or disagreements. Of course we will! But we can always solve them in a kind, loving, soft-spoken way.

### The challenge

I bet many of you have grown up in homes where yelling was common. I am sure some of you yell at your spouse or kids now even. I plead with you...stop it! Don't yell at your spouse. Don't yell at your kids. Don't let your kids yell at you. If you feel yourself boiling up with anger, take a step back and walk away if you need to.

**Marriage and family are the most important things in this world. Don't hurt what matters most to you by saying hurtful things with a loud voice...it will never, be a good way to solve a problem.**
