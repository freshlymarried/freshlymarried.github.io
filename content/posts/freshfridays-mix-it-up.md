MIX IT UP. Some routines are happily comfortable and don't need changing. **But if you start to feel yourself wanting more out of your time together then you know a change would be good**. You have to be willing to try something new, though, or you'll get the same old results! Doesn't have to be big but enough to continue progressing and being freshly married!
