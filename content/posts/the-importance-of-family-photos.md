As you have noticed, we got some new family photos done :) And I'm loving them! I had been watching my friend Nicky post so many amazing pictures she has taken of families and couples, and knew that she could give us the memorable photos we were looking for. Throughout the process I was so impressed with her professionalism, expertise, artistic eye, and even encouragement that we looked cute, haha. I just had a really great experience with her and wanted to mention that as I share a few photos from this shoot. Of course, these are only a few of my favs so you'll have to see more as I share them periodically through my blog posts and quotes! Thanks [Nicholette Photography](http://nicholettephotography.com/)! I can't wait to frame these in the stairwell collage I'm working on!

#### The Why

I think putting family pictures up in your home is so important. Growing up we only updated our family photo every 8 years, maybe? And all but one time were they taken at a wedding, haha. Which is fine, I actually don't think it's necessary to do yearly pictures. But a lot can change in even just a few years. It's nice to be able to look at a more recent photo of the two of you and feel the comfort and trust from the new person they become with time. Getting photos taken can be an extra expense, yes, but I look at it as an investment in that supportive feeling today and every day for years to come :)

I remember hearing some good advice about this a year ago from somebody. I can't remember how it was said exactly, but he explained how important it is to hang up your wedding photos and couple photos for your children to see every day. He also said to update them so they see continue to see the love you have for each other as the years go on. I agree with this because I believe it can bring about a feeling of commitment to each other that you AND your children will both feel! It will be felt in the home over the years, but will also be carried with your children when they leave and embark in their own romantic relationships. I don't know about you but I sure feel the commitment here!

I'm also very happy to finally have a decent photograph of the both of us in front of our house! Somehow we have only gotten selfies, which is sad because it's our first house! That's why I thought it was pretty neat that Nicky gives her clients a mounted 8x10 of the family in front of their house with their shoot :) A home is where we spend most of our time and where we make the most memories, so to have that is a special keepsake! And we lucked out with amazing cloudy blue skies that reflect so beautifully in the reflection of our windows!

#### Never Forget

As I look at these pictures of us, I'm just feeling grateful for our family of two so far, and all that we've done to get here. Where our lives are right now without kids, I can't imagine saying that first child cliche, "I don't even remember what life was like without you in our family!" (Sorry, not sorry!) I'm sure our life just gets better with bringing children into our life, but I can't ever forget these wonderful years of just being a couple! If you tend to say this then you need to add more pictures of just you two in your house, so that you can remember this absolutely significant time in your life! I never want to forget these smiles and cuddles, even if there are plenty more to come :)
