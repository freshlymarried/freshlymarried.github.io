### Background/reminder

This is week 1 of my campaign/project/whatever about focusing on the joys in my marriage. I talked about this whole idea and why in our [Christmas card blog post](http://freshlymarried.com/be-joyful/) but basically the reasoning for it is this: I don't like the pressure that comes with trying to be happy. It's as if we think we aren't/won't/can't be overall happy if the majority of our day had sad or difficult moments. It's the same thing if you apply it to marriage.

I believe that if we focus on the joys in marriage, we can have a better outlook on it; from the current circumstances to the future success of it. So my plan is to share a joy in my marriage every week! **Because with seven days, even the unhappy marriages can find something to be joyous about! It's about the little victories people! Those build to make up the big victories!**

Last week we had a minor tiff over the dishes. Our process of cleaning and loading the dishes is just different and it's something we have danced around multiple times in our marriage already, like I'm sure most of you have, haha. (It's always a tiff over some kind of chore, right?!)

We both got a little defensive but we listened to what each of us preferred when it came to doing the dishes, came up with a compromise, and then came up with ideas on how we each could make that happen. We both worked at that and have noticed a positive difference already just in 5 days! And we appreciated each other for it :)

**This small compromise + a different effort this time on both sides made a noticeable impact on our marriage. And that is why it brought us joy in our marriage this week.**

The best part about participating is that not only have you just thought about your marriage in a positive way and gave some public praise to your spouse, but you've also inspired a friend who follows you, to do the same! Let's help each other find a more joyful marriage :)**
