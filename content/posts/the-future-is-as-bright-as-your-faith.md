Three years ago I wrote this message to Trevor on the back of a picture quote as encouragement that we could do the long distance thing. (I'm sad we can't find the original right now but glad I took a picture of the smeared message I wrote him!) The story behind this little message set a precedent for our relationship and it's one I think every couple needs reminding of :)

#### LONG STORY SHORT

After almost three weeks of enjoying a Christmas break together while we were dating, it came time for Trevor to go back to school. It was going to be hard going back to the distance and not seeing each other until the weekends. I remember thinking about this in my bedroom, and I looked up and saw this picture quote I had on my wall from Thomas S. Monson that said "The future is as bright as your faith." Out of the hundreds of photos of my friends, my family, memories, and quotes, I found this one and decided to give it to Trevor.  It was something that eased our goodbye, and helped him know that things were going to work out for us, but I also think it helped him have faith in our relationship.

I mentioned in a previous post that before Trevor proposed to me, he was waiting for me to take a step of commitment to him and to us. That step was moving to be closer to him, so we could experience more with each other than just weekend feelings of "I missed you all week!" After he went back to school from the winter break I think he had to have a lot of faith that I would have the courage to pack up and start a new job to be with him. I didn't find out until a few months later, but this was going to be a deal breaker for him whether or not I took that step!

On my side, I also had to have faith during that time that things would work out in finding a new job from the one I already felt comfortable with, as well as finding an apartment. I could have just said, "Starting a whole new job and getting roommates all over again gives me such anxiety!" However, I didn't, and we all know how that turned out :) I got a job and an apartment became available for me in his same complex, all within about two weeks!

We saw our future together being so so bright! Because of this perspective, I had much more desire to make sacrifices for Trevor than I have ever had for any person. I felt more hope and courage in our relationship than any other one I've had, including friends and family. Trevor put his faith in me and I put my faith in him. If we hadn't done that, it's possible we wouldn't be together today!

#### Believe in your spouse

**If we keep faith in our spouse, it's easier to see the positive future ahead. On the other side, if we lose faith in our spouse, it can be hard to see a positive future ahead. Don't lose faith in each other!** Work on those faults and shortcomings, and demonstrate to your spouse that you are trying. And have faith that your spouse can overcome their faults and shortcomings. **BELIEVE IN EACH OTHER!** When someone you love doesn't believe you can do something, you almost don't even want to try anymore, right? Believing we can overcome trials individually and together is what creates a bright future for our marriages!![thomas s monson, thomas s monson quotes, future as bright as your faith, your future is as bright as your faith, your future is as bright as your faith quote, believe in your marriage, believe in your spouse, have faith in your spouse, have faith in yourself, overcoming trials in marriage, newlyweds, faith in your marriage, marriage advice, marriage help, marriage encouragement, newlywed encouragement](/images/doubt-and-faith.png)I encourage you to choose faith!
