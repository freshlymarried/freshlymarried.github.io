This week my focus is on the importance of recording the memories in marriage! I talk about how important it is to journal the little details [here](http://freshlymarried.com/memory-lane/), with 10 ideas for how you can do that! I also wrote [here](http://freshlymarried.com/the-importance-of-family-photos/) about how important it is to update your family photos often AND make sure to hang them up in your house!

After going on our vacation to Hawaii, part of me was wishing I had another fun way of documenting that fun... I wanted to get me an [Instax camera](https://amzn.to/2H9HILn)! Since I don't want you regretting this for your fun summer vacations, I wanted to give one away!

It comes with batteries, hand strap, and an Instant Film Twin Pack so you can get shooting right away! (Prize valued at $100)\[/caption\]

Photographs like this are fun and a little retro. They catch moments rather than all the little imperfections that our smartphones pick up, haha. Think of all the cute memories of your date nights and summer activities you can take pictures of! And who doesn't look cool holding a cute blue camera?! ;) If you or your spouse would like to win this awesome prize, there are two options for all you need to do:
