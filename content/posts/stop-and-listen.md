When life gets busy, it's easy to just keep going and going, working at that to-do list. We let the little greetings we give to each other be enough. But you can't go DAYS without _truly_ talking with your spouse. Each of you NEEDS that.

Whatever time of day it is that you are reading this, take that important pause in your busy schedule to ask your spouse how they are doing, in their day, in their week, or even in their current personal struggle. Whatever you ask, take the time required to listen to them.

Just like all the Freshly Married advice that is given, doing this can keep you connected, and bring you and your spouse closer.

:)
