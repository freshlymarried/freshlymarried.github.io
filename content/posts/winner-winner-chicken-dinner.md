Well folks, we have drawn a name out of the hat, with a winner to announce for our Boast and Brag Giveaway! Thank you so much for everyone who entered with your wonderful comments! We love hearing all of the great things that your spouses are doing to strengthen your marriage. It not only strengthens our marriage in in reading them, but Iâ€™m sure it does the same for the readers, as well.

The winner of the $25 Olive Garden gift card towards a date night is...

### Sabrina!

Thank you to you and your husband for being a great example to us. We hope that you read her comment on how her and her husband have kept their marriage _fresh_, as well as [all of the other AMAZING comments](http://freshlymarried.com/the-boast-brag-giveaway/#comments).

The point of this giveaway was to encourage positive feelings about each of your spouses or special someones. We truly hope this has done that for you. This experience has been quite enjoyable for us, so we hope that you will keep your eyes out for more giveaways in the future. :)

Helping couples keep their love fresh, Amy
