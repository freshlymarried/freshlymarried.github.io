## Making your own marriage recipe

So you have your ingredients list above, and now you need the directions to follow, but **_where_** do you find those directions to follow? 3 ways you find those directions:

1. You study and learn through credible books, classes, and advice from others.
2. You pull from your past relationship experiences of what worked and what didn't work. Generally, what didn't work for one relationship probably won't work for the other. However, every relationship combination is different so...
3. You learn from trial and error. You pull from your experiences with this particular relationship. When you are cooking up a recipe for date night, you know the ingredients you need and you know the directions to approaching a successful date night (do the things they like and avoid the things they don't like).

I hope this post didn't make your mouth water for a cookie TOO much, haha, but I am a sucker for relating things in life to marriage in hopes that we can learn something from it. Â Ultimately, you are creating this recipe with your spouse. It takes time to "perfect" it, especially for newlyweds. You'll make mistakes that you will learn from. However, that's how the yummiest recipes were discovered through trial and error! That's how chocolate chip cookies were actually discovered! (Going back to that comparison AGAIN haha). You have the knowledge and tools to make your marriage the best it can be, and I hope you'll apply those in your marriage every day!
