### The joy I found in my marriage this week: that feeling when you kiss and make-up.

You all know the feeling I'm referring to because you've felt it yourselves many times, I'm sure of it! It sucks when you disappoint each other because you don't agree on something. But it's also a reality of marriage because you are two different people joining your lives together. Â It still doesn't feel good to hit that low, but man is it good to go back and hit that high :)

That's all I'm gonna say.
