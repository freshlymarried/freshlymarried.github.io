Everyone can feel loved differently because we each have different [love languages](http://freshlymarried.com/love-languages-part-1-understanding/) we speak. Sometimes your love needs to be shown in a certain way. However, it requires your time no matter how you show it! Be willing to give up your time to do something special for your spouse, to say something special to them, or just plain be with them :)

# Give time to your spouse today!
