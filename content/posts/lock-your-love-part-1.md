I used to go to Dixie State University (it was Dixie State College when I went), so I lived down in good ole St. George, Utah! I loved it there so much. I could go on forever about why I love St. George but that would take all day! So I'm just going to share this one majorly awesome thing that came from living down there. I found this awesome gate!

#### A Reaffirming symbol

It's a "Lock Your Love" gate! Couples bring a padlock and symbolically lock it onto a bridge (or gate in our case) as a way to protect their love forever! There were all kinds of locks, people mostly [do this one](http://lovelocksonline.com/) that coordinates with the idea. Ones with keys, combinations (that's what we did), and some that don't even have a way to unlock them. Some couples actually save their key or remember the combination to come back and actually unlock then re-lock it as a way of reaffirming their love for each other! I think that is also beautiful symbolism emphasizing the need to recommit ourselves to our marriage periodically.

Little sentiments like this always tug at my heart-strings so I put it on my life bucket list to go there one day with my husband and lock our love together! Well, back in May I made it happen! I secretly ordered a [cute red heart-shaped lock](https://amzn.to/2HkckWp) and then engraved our name and wedding date on it :) We then locked our love on the gate!

#### A Reminder

Over New Year's we found ourselves on vacation in St. George again with family and I decided we needed to go back and see our heart lock. So we did! Trevor was surprised I wanted to go back and see it just months after putting it there because he figured it hadn't moved, haha. I totally agreed but **there was a symbolism behind it for me that when we go back to see our lock on that gate, we are reminded of our love for each other.** I know that seems cheesy! I mean, we say "I love you" every day to each other and we truly feel it. **It's not that I _need_ to be reminded of our love, but it's that I _want_ to be reminded.** I mean, why not, right? :)

If you think this idea is neat and want to "lock your love" with your spouse somewhere, you can find many sites around the world that participate in this tradition [here](https://www.pacsafe.com/blog/how-to-lock-your-love/). The sad thing is the weight of the locks can become a safety issue for some bridges, so they can get removed by the city. That changes the whole idea, doesn't it?! haha. That is why I am glad I found this gate. And I love that we live close enough to ensure we will come back and see it from time to time. There is some more symbolism I have pulled from this idea of "locking your love," that I will share in part 2 to come!

Here are some more locks I found that are even more stylish for locking your love! The [double-heart gold lock](https://amzn.to/2qP0ZGF) is blank on the backside so you can personally engrave it. For those who like the idea of coming back to their lock and want to re-lock their love, get [the antique padlock](https://amzn.to/2K0O6SG) with keys!
