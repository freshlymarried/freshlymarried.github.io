Ready for these two exciting announcements?

1. We are moving!
2. We bought a house!

#### Yep. This just got real.

It's awesome yet crazy, and just a huge step in our lives but we are so excited to take that step! Though the idea of moving has been in the works for us for about five months, the opportunity with this specific house came up quick. And when I mean quick, I mean that we had three days to decide on it, haha. The house had pretty much everything that we wanted in a home - it was our favorite floor plan in our price range, and with other awesome factors that played into buying this house, it was an offer we couldn't refuse.

We are feeling so blessed to be able to do this early in our marriage. Our plan originally was to stay in Provo for about 3 or 4 years, but as I'm sure we all know, life changes! We have so many great memories in Provo and have gotten to know some amazing people here, but now it's time to move on to a new city. But guess what? We'll be moving to South Jordan, into the Daybreak community, which is only a 35-40 minute drive north of Provo. We are still close enough to visit, and I'll be commuting here to school during the week. Since we have about five weeks until the house is completed, we are going to live it up here in Provo, checking off some bucket list items, haha.

If you read one of my last posts, ["The Thing About Provo,"](http://freshlymarried.com/the-thing-about-provo/) you'll know that Trevor and I have been having some confused feelings about living in Provo, and that we've been praying for an answer to these feelings. This was our answer, and we're feeling very good about it. Even though everything about the idea of moving there was in our favor, I was still hesitant emotionally. I was worried about having to re-establish ourselves in a new city, ward (a church community), and neighborhood, all of which can be a difficult transition. After a lot of conversations with Trevor and a lot of prayer, I felt like that one reason of fear was not a big enough reason to turn it down. Making new friends can be difficult, but it gets easier. We will still have our current friends. And leaving a place that has so much sentimental value will always be bittersweet. We are going to leave Provo eventually, so why just do it now, since we are ready? Ever since I came to that realization I have felt a lot of comfort and happiness knowing we are doing what's best for us. I'm grateful for those feelings.

#### A new adventure

I'm not saying that I won't be sad the day we move out of our first little apartment, because I will. In fact, I'll probably ball my eyes out when we close the door! And I'm not saying I won't miss all the friendships I've made here, because I will miss everyone so much! There are people that have made an impact on my lives and they don't even know it, and there's some people that I know I'll stay in touch with for many years to come (Thank goodness for facebook, right?). Knowing all of this makes me even more excited to make new friendships somewhere else. It gives me encouragement knowing there are probably people in Daybreak that will also impact my life.

I'm just really looking forward to this new adventure "freshly married" adventure! The adventure might not include a fully furnished home right away, but we are fine with that :) It may not include quick friendships, but that's what family and existing friends are for! And of course, Trevor and I will always have each other. {Cue the home cliches: "Home is wherever I'm with you," or "Home is where the heart is," etc.} hahahaha. 

This process was definitely interesting for us. We learned a lot about God's plan for us, we learned a lot about each other, and also about ourselves. I know that everything happens for a reason and that timing is everything. So I will have to share this whole story in another post. :)
