#freshfridays quote asking "Have you had your six-second kiss today?"

I don't think we should look at the word 'potential' with an eye-roll, because it doesn't mean a long kiss has to lead to sex. An extra long kiss is just more special than the quick kiss goodbye or quick kiss when getting home from work.

**So I think the 'potential' he's referring to is focused more on how that kind of intentional and more meaningful kiss can lead to a more meaningful relationship; more meaningful days together; more meaningful emotional intimacy.** And if you want it to, yes it can lead to more meaningful physical intimacy.

So at some point today or maybe every day this week, try that 6-second long kiss to see if it makes a difference in your marriage!
