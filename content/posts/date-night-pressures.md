Everyone knows that I'm a big promoter of date night. Especially with my giveaways. I just believe that it's important to have time together alone with your spouse. :) But I don't want to give anyone the idea that your time together has to be epic enough to be given the "date night" title. **Date night shouldn't feel pressured.**

**All quality time is important!** And in some life circumstances, we have to take what we can get, right?! However, I do believe that when you give your time together a label of "date night" it makes it different from the other nights you spend together. It gives it slightly more importance I think. And even though you can look forward to being together at any time, planning a date night ahead of time can give you something to look forward to even more.

#### Spend it wisely

In the beginning of our marriage, I used to call every night we spent time together a "date night" haha. Which is fine, but I think using it so much diminished some of its specialness. So I think it's all about balancing it; making sure you are spending a fair amount of time alone together, but then occasionally making an extra effort to have that time together be a little more special; something that you actually get yourself ready for and look decent, haha. #nosweatpants

**Classify what a "date night" means for your own relationship.** You don't have to compare it to anyone else's definition, necessarily. You might consider going to the grocery store together a date night while others don't. It's fine! **As long as your time together is meaningful to you, that's what matters.** My only suggestion is that to avoid complacency and to keep it interesting, make your kinds of "date nights" a little extra special every once in awhile. :)
