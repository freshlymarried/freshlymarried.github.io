And by good things, I don't just mean that it opens the opportunity for sex! haha. I think that by ending your night with a kiss sets you up for good feelings before you go to sleep. Good feelings or bad feelings can be the difference between staying up all night or having a beautiful sleep!

Don't get me wrong here, I'm not saying that if you don't kiss your spouse goodnight that you are a terrible spouse, or that you'll have bad feelings before you fall asleep! There are plenty of times where we haven't given each other a kiss goodnight and obviously we were fine! But isn't that kind of a cute habit to have every night? I feel like ONLY good can come from that!Â **You may not _lose_ anything for not having a goodnight kiss, but you might have something to _gain_ from that kiss!**
