This quote below is great to remember in times of disconnection and conflict. We try to look on their surface for any emotion to provide us with answers, but what's showing on the outside might not be how they _actually_ feel or think.

You may think _"He looks like he could care less right now! He's stone-cold to me and doesn't care about a resolution OR ME!"_ That might be what it looks like on the surface. However, **don't forget that you've laid so much of a strong foundation in your roots that's full of a strong friendship, and deep emotional intimacy.** I think deep down, your spouse truly loves you and doesn't ever want to intentionally hurt you, even though it might appear that way in a situation and in the heat of the moment.

It's easy to forget, which is why this has been important for me to remember because I can be pretty sensitive to little things! **So this quote helps remind us to give our spouse the benefit of the doubt, to not jump to conclusions so quickly, and** **to keep in mind the bigger perspective.**
