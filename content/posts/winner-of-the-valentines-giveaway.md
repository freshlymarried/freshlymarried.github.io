Thank you to everyone who entered the giveaway. We loved hearing everyone's comments about how they try to make every day feel like Valentine's Day for their spouse! We have definitely taken notes from them. I hope everyone else goes back and reads each other's comments to learn from them as well, because we all could use some advice, right?

The prize up for grabs is a $25 Cinemark movie theater gift card good towards a date night for Valentine's Day, or whenever you are feeling like taking out your sweetheart! After a random draw, the winner is....

#### TJ Morrison!

I want to wish everyone a great Valentine's Day. May it be full of love, love, love. It doesn't need to be shown in a big, expensive, or extravagant way. Just give an extra special, "I love you," to your sweetheart. And if you are thinking about swooning over a romantic movie this weekend, don't forget:

### The greatest love story ever told is your own.
