### Pornography is one of the biggest threats to marriages and families.

Sex is the number 1 topic searched on the Internet (NCPCE Online, "Current Statistics," Internet, http://www.nationalcoalition.org/stat.html). The American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers reported the biggest factors in divorce cases:

-  68% of the divorces involved one party meeting a new lover over the Internet.
-  56% involved one party having "an obsessive interest in pornographic websites."

These statistics are disgusting and sad. I agree with completely with Gordan B. Hinckley, who said, "Pornography is not some titillating feast for the eyes that gives a momentary rush of excitement. \[Rather\] it has the effect of damaging hearts and souls to their very depths, strangling the life out of relationships that should be sacred, hurting to the very core those you should love the most." (https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2004/10/a-tragic-evil-among-us).

### I believe we can fight this terrible disease! We don't have to be a part of it.

The government has set up a petition, which you can sign, to force pornographic material to be an "Opt-in" feature. The petition needs 100,000 signatures to be considered.

All you have to do is create a quick and simple government account: [https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/require-porn-be-opt-feature-internet-service-providers-rather-standard-feature/GF1RkqpJ) Amy and I urge you to sign this petition before it closes tomorrow!

If you, your spouse, or someone you know struggles with pornography, a wonderful resource to find help is [http://overcomingpornography.org](http://overcomingpornography.org).

Trying to keep our marriages fresh and safe, Trevor
