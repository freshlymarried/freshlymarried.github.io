Hi. Wedding shower fun here! Last weekend I threw my SIL a bridal shower and it was great! I literally spent two months planning and getting excited to do it because I had a fun idea that was unique to her and unique to bridal showers in general. She LOVES hunting, fishing, that outdoorsy stuff, AND perfectly enough --- her fiance loves all of that too! So I thought it was a fun idea to do a hunting themed shower for her... **"THE HUNT IS OVER!"**

My hours on pinterest paid off in a way that pointed me in the right direction, but helped me put my own spin on it. There were a few ideas of hunting themed parties for either retirement of an avid hunter, or even "pink camo" style bridal showers. BUT my SIL hates pink camo, haha. So I had some inspiration, but was able to do it a little differently :) I wanted it to be girly, lovey-dovey (celebrating love here!), and also be outdoorsy but not have it turn into an 8 year old boy's army themed birthday party! Soooo I chose to go with bright green, hunter green, gold, ivory, kraft color, and burlap for the color scheme.

[This banner](https://amzn.to/2JWpKth) hung above the trail mix bar to help complete the look.

Happened to find these awesome gold foil deer stickers that went perfectly with the invitations and envelopes.  :) There are some similar on [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2JTugsz) from the same brand.

 I took out a painting in this barn wood frame and used it for the day, haha. Twine and clothespins went well too.

[The resin antler "C"](https://amzn.to/2Hat6Y2) was just perf for decor and so they can keep it for home decor or something personal later :)

When I found that fun phrase: "He took a shot, and she said yes!" I KNEW I HAD TO USE IT! I put it on the invitations and for their cute little photo collage.

She is doing a barn style wedding so they had a bunch of logs already cut for other decor. I figured, that's perfect for this too, let's do it!

The trail mix bar was one of my favorite parts that I was super excited about! I tried to do catchy labels that worked with the snack item, and the hunting theme:

**"Catch of the day" -- Swedish Fish**

**"Happy Trails" -- Trail Mix**

**"Amunition" -- Chocolate covered coconut balls**

**"Gone Fishin" -- Goldfish crackers**

**"Got Bait?" -- Gummy Worms**

**"Camo Mix" -- Mint M&M'S and Hershey's almond drops**

We had a beautiful table display with other awesome treats!

I did "Cowgirl cookies" which were my famous oatmeal chocolate chip recipe but with green and brown M&M minis on top :)

And no I didn't spend 30 minutes separating the colors of the M&M minis.... ok I did.

We did magic bars -- "Trail mix bars," Lime bars/tarts because they were green, and Smore's cupcakes :)

Sad story: I made the cupcakes and was so proud of how they looked but I somehow never actually ate one myself, haha.

Weddings can be stressful, but bridal showers can be fun! People tend to get wrapped up in the little details of the celebration. I even noticed myself doing that with planning this shower! However celebrating a marriage is not about this stuff! **It's not about all the gifts, or the decorations, or the refreshments. It's about celebrating two people who found love and who want to commit their lives to each other!** Of course, these things can make the celebration more fun and memorable, but it's all so temporal. I mean, these cupcakes lasted for like 6 hours. It's the marriage that is going to last forever :)

**Start "forever" off right and don't stress about the little details.**

P.S. I DID NOT do this without help! Thanks to the whole fam for making treats, cleaning, arranging and decorating :)
