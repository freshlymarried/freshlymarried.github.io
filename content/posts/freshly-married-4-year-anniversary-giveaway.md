## HAPPY FOUR YEARS!

Four years ago today, I wrote my very first blog post on Freshly Married, called ["The Iron,"](https://freshlymarried.com/the-iron-2/)  about a lesson I learned with an iron (obviously), that taught me what it truly means to be a good wife, even though I had only been married for a few short weeks. Though we've been married for longer now and have had several more tough experiences than this one, this iron experience helped launch the message behind Freshly Married, which you can read more about [here.](https://freshlymarried.com/about/)

I've been happily blessed with this passion of trying to help others strengthen and FRESHEN UP their marriage, and in the process, they have helped MY marriage grow! I've been able to connect and relate to others through 300 blog posts, a Facebook group community, and the people who message me weekly asking for relationship advice or thanking me for sharing something they needed to hear. That is incredibly rewarding to me, and I hope to have more years of this!

I'm grateful for a husband who helps make my website function, who gives me great tips for improving FM, and who so graciously provides for us, allowing me to pursue this journey dedicated to helping others. I'm grateful to be surrounded by spouses who recognize how important their marriage is, and who are yearning for ways to strengthen their marriage each day. You guys are my inspiration, and the reason why I continue to do what I do.
