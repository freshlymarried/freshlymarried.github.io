Our one year anniversary is coming up, and I am finding myself getting more excited about it each day! I've been thinking about how things were a year ago, and how far we have come since then. I have started looking back at our first year with such gratitude for the blessings that have come, and also for the trials that we have seen. And then I stumble upon all the cute things that made me fall in love with Trevor in the first place :) And that puts me in an instant twitterpated state of mind, haha. I just love my boy and am thankful for every part of him.

#### Gift ideas

In celebrating our one year anniversary, I have been doing some research on gift ideas. I actually didn't know there was traditional list of anniversary gifts for each year. I found the list on [Hallmark](http://www.hallmark.com/anniversary/ideas/anniversary-gift-ideas/), and I'm not quite sure I like it. I mean, it's great, because it gives you a general theme to go around, so you can still be creative, but I just don't think that's me. If we were to follow this list into our 40th and 50th anniversaries, it seems like jewelry would be the gift... I'm not a fan of expensive jewelry. Though I have seen a lot of sources providing ideas for a first anniversary gift (paper), I haven't heard of many couples following these gift ideas. Have you? I don't think it's a bad idea, I just don't think I'm going to follow it... Does anyone else feel that way, too?

When it comes to gifts, I'm all about trying to make it something meaningful, surprising, and nostalgic or sentimental in some way. That's how Trevor is too. Of course, we get each other practical things sometimes, because we are practical people. However, when it comes to celebrating an anniversary of when we became husband and wife, I want it to be special no matter how big or small it is!

#### Conclusion

There is a part of me that isn't sure if I need to do a specific gift, because we are actually celebrating our anniversary with a little getaway vacation :) We have some fun and relaxing things planned for each day, including one specific crazy thing that we've both never done before, and another special thing that we couldn't think of a better way to spend our anniversary doing. I've been wondering if all of this is a gift in itself for the both of us... Do I need to do something else, too?

I think I've decided what I'm going to do, but I can't quite say it on here because Trevor will read this too, haha. But I want to hear your thoughts on anniversary gifts. Do you follow the traditional gift list, or do your own thing? Do you and your spouse have something specific you do to celebrate each year? Comment and tell us, as it may help other couples like us, who are not sure what to do!
