Do you guys know Stuart Edge? My husband and I just recently found [his uplifting videos](https://www.youtube.com/user/stuartedge) on youtube and every time I watch them I think, "How cool is it that he can just give away money in really neat ways and make people happy?! I wish I could do that!" Well I'm definitely not made of money but I genuinely love doing nice things for people, especially if it truly does help them in some way. In this case, I love doing things that can be a help or even just a nice gesture for other marriages!

Soooooo of course I'm giving a date night giveaway to my readers because what's better than a night out just the two of you? A FREE night out on the town just the two of you!! This prize is a $50 visa gift card to use towards a date night, just in time for Valentine's day! It also comes with some other Freshly Married content that is personalized for you :) This contest is happening over on our [Freshly Married instagram](https://www.instagram.com/freshlymarried/) so make sure to follow us.

When we have done giveaways in the past, my heart always smiles at the love I can see that you guys have towards your spouses! That's why a giveaway entry has something to do with complimenting your spouse, sharing advice or stories from your marriage, etc :) The point is not to reach popularity for my blog, though that is cool too. It is to get people thinking positively about their marriage! And in the process, trying to win something!

This giveaway is super easy to enter and I'm looking forward to awarding it to a randomly picked couple!

P.S. I plan on doing a giveaway once a month so make sure to stay up to date on all our social media accounts for specific giveaways!
