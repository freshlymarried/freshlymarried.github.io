The day before I came down with a nasty influenza I announced my video course: _“How to Navigate Your Differences.”_ I also said that to celebrate I was going to do an awesome giveaway prize, and then… well the flu. Haha. And then it was my birthday so here we are now!

I just want to say that I have been so excited about this video course, because it's so applicable for ALL marriages, no matter what stage you are in, or how deep your problems are! For more info on this check out my [courses page](https://freshlymarried.com/courses/).
