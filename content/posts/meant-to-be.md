#### Sharing time

These pictures depict our lives before we "re-met" and started dating. Trevor was serving a Latter-Day Saint mission across the country while I was living at home, working at a craft store, and riding my scooter around trying to find myself again.

Though it was tough at times, these experiences were great for each of us to gain a new perspective and discover what we really wanted and what we were ready for... each other. While we both yearned for a person we couldn't put a face or name to yet, we kept preparing and bettering ourselves for when we could.

We both spent so much time hoping + wishing + praying to find each other during the time these pics were taken. So I love that I printed these for our chalkboard as a frequent reminder that we were meant to find each other! We were exactly what the other needed and _still are_.   #meanttobe
