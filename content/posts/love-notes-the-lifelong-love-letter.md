My husband and I have both mentioned in posts how much we enjoy [giving and receiving love notes](http://freshlymarried.com/i-love-love-notes/) from each other. I really think there's an awesome power that comes with love notes. Having a physical copy of how your spouse feels about you is something you can refer to in years to come, which makes it more special. Trevor and I used to write more to each other while we were dating, and I think it's because we lived an hour away from each other. Every so often when I reorganize our memorabilia I'll stumble upon something one of us wrote to the other and it just takes me back to those days, even that special moment when first reading it. :) Some of those initial twitterpaited feelings come back and I just love it! Having moments like this where we can look back on the sweet nothings we say to our spouse can give us a boost on days we feel down in our marriage or down individually.

These notes we give to our spouse say what we are feeling in our marriage through good or bad days and years, and through the various life transitions. **I believe every written note, whether it's 50 sentences long or just a few words, is a compilation of a lifelong love letter to our spouse :)** When you think about it that way, it puts a special significance on these. Even just writing this post has made me realize how much more I should write notes to my husband!

Because love notes to our spouse can be very important to our marriage, I have come up with some cute ways for you to do this, and it will make you want to do this more often! Of course, a plain white lined paper is perfectly great to write a note on, but it's WAY more fun to write it on cute cards! Like all these ones:

These started as scrapbooking cards that slide into plastic album pockets for memory keeping but I now use them to write little notes to people :) I picked out all the pink and red ones I could find and actually made them Valentine's this year, haha. What I love about these is that each side has a front and back with a phrase, pattern, or design written on one side of a card, then space on the other side where you can write something. I have a bunch of collections from different brands so the variety of designs and options to use them is plentiful! I wrote on a few to show you how I have thought of using them, and I'll go over the ways I have used them or plan on using them :)

As you can see from the pictures, some of the cards have calendar options on them. **You can write down a specific date night, a time, a place, and hand it to your spouse!** Or maybe slide it under the door of a room they are in, haha. Or mail it to their office, maybe?! How cute would that be to receive a date night card at your work?! This might be cute for those who are big fans of The Bachelor hahaha.

Is it just me or is anyone else a sucker for camera designs??? All of these cameras are stinkin' cute to me, and the first thing I think of when I want to use them to record memories is "that was a picture-perfect memory." **So these cards would be perfect for reminding my spouse about a special memory from our life together.** Maybe it was something that literally just happened the night before! I could leave a note for him in his car that says, "We laughed so hard last night and I loved every minute. Thank you for creating that beautiful picture-perfect moment for us!"  (Gahh! Doesn't this make you excited to go write love notes??!)

I like finding cards that have a special quote or awesome saying on it that is good to remember in life :) **Sometimes your spouse needs some cheering up, so writing them a note that has an encouraging phrase along with your personal encouraging words could help them feel better**. Sometimes your spouse needs to be inspired with some cool quote that spawns that creativity they have been looking for :) Of course there are cooler quotes than the ones I have pictured above, but you get the idea!

#### Final Note

If you have your own way of writing love notes to your spouse, that is totally fine! Keep going, because at least you do it! If you are interested in adopting this idea there are a few ways you can make it happen. Go to your craft store and find cards like this in the scrapbooking aisle. There are a few brands like Project Life, Snap, or We Are Memory Keepers. There are many styles and collections so you can make it your own. You can also just look at the individual scrapbooking papers! There are neat designs and they typically have a back side that has lines of some sort to write on. You can cut those down to any size you want, too! If you want to know the specific collection and brands I have pictured above, just message me and I'll give you the deets!

NOTE TO THE HUSBANDS: there are some "manly" cards out there too! Not all of them are cutesy-wootsy, so you can find some to use too! No excuses ;)

Tell me what you think about this idea, or the other ways you write love notes to your spouse!
