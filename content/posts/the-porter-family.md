\[caption id="attachment\_2465" align="aligncenter" width="450"\]![The Porter Family, newlywed advice, newlywed spotlight, newlywed advice, relationship help, relationship advice](images/Porter-Family-300x199.jpg) My guy and I first met June 27, 2010 with no intent of dating and just being buddies. However, with a summer filled with fireworks, fairs, and bbq's we realized we were much more than friends.\[/caption\]

We spent the following two years dating, enjoying life, and spending as much time together as possible. August 18, 2012 my sweet love and I were sealed in the Mt. Timpanogos Temple. We chose that temple because it was the first temple we ever visited together making our day that much more sweet.

My husband and I keep our marriage fresh by remembering to stay young! Honestly in this day and age its hard to remember how young we really are. We remind ourselves it's OK to stay up pastÂ 9 pm! It's easy to fall into a routine, but your 20's are all about adventure and excitement, so we try to keep that in our lives with lots and lots of traveling and exploring new places.

We also keep our marriage fresh by making sure we go on at least one date a week. To give each other that special one on one time that we need. Bonding time is so important to us.

We've also taken the time to evaluate each others needs in our marriage. Have you ever read the 5 love languages? I would recommend it to anyone just because it teaches you so much about how to love your spouse the way they need love, not how you think they need love.

Staying Freshly Married,  
The Porters
