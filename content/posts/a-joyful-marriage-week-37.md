### The joy I found in my marriage this week: cute banter :)

We love being silly with each other, just like any other couple! Because it's fun to tease each other, right? I gotta share a memorable one from this week :)

Whenever I give my husband a piece of gum, he ALWAYS gives me the wrapper, haha. Sometimes it happens when there's an obvious trash can near by or he has a pocket he can stick it in himself. He just likes to make me deal with it for fun (smile emoji / eyeroll emoji). Well, we were in the car the other day and he hands me his gum wrapper and I gave a silly groan. And his response as he laughed: "Be grateful. Not everyone has a husband who gives them trash." Needless to say, we had a good laugh over it.

I'm grateful for little moments like this where we can be silly and light-hearted with each other because no one wants their relationship to be serious all the time. Playfulness like that is something we've strived for more of lately, and it's working. :)
