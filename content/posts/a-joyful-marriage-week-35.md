**I'm happy to say that I've truly felt some joys this past week that have left me feeling content with life and my marriage! I have found joy in letting things go.** I'm trying to not take disagreements so personally, and it allows us to roll them off our back more. I'm also trying to let go of things I can't change -- specifically the fact that I have to have a second sinus surgery in a few weeks. I found that out earlier this week and I thought it would put a damper on the rest of the week but I just realized that there is no way around it, and I can sit and stew about it until it actually happens, or I can try and enjoy the present with my husband and our dog.

**Another joy is trying new things together.** I have shared this joy before, and I'm glad that it's been a repeating joy here and there because it's important to try new things in your marriage! Trevor spontaneously decided to play chess with me and teach me. So we have played twice now, including this picture of us playing at our own little spot at the lake for date night :) I'm sure it's annoying for him to wait so long for me to come up with a move, but maybe one day I'll get good enough to actually be a challenge for him ;)Â Feeling grateful for the little family that I have been blessed with.
