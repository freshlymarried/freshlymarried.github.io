## The joy I found in my marriage this week: There are still new things to discover about each other.

It was my birthday this week and Trevor managed to surprise me with a few things that I feel very blessed to receive. They were things I have told him about and were on my wish list but he just knew the colors, styles, and other specifics I would prefer when it came to these thoughtful gifts. He just knows me so well, right?

And then over my birthday dinner out (and most other restaurant dinners), we tried asking each other questions covering a variety of subjects. Most of the time we can internally guess what the other person's answers will be because we think we know each other well enough. And this is very true, we do know each other so well, to the point where our guesses are mostly correct. That's awesome, BUT what's more awesome is when those answers lead to more questions and answers, which occasionally lead to a NEW answer we didn't know!

For example, at our Valentine's Day lunch one of us asked the other a question, which led to a conversation about something, which led us to find out we both LOVE almond poppyseed cakes/muffins :) SOMEHOW we didn't know that about each other yet, haha. When it came to this week's dinner, the new answers were on the topic of lobster, haha.
