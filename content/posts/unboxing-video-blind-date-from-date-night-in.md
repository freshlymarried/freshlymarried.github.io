Date boxes have been a new thing the past few years, and I think are recently gaining more traction for couples, especially those with busy lives. Last year my husband and I experimented with date boxes to see what they are all about, and to see if they would give us added fun in our marriage :)

I wrote an article on [how date boxes work](https://freshlymarried.com/what-you-should-know-about-date-boxes/), so if you're not familiar with the concept, check that out. We then tried out four different date boxes from four different companies and I shared all of my thoughts on those as well! One of the companies/products I was most impressed with was [Date Night In](https://datenightinbox.com), and they have been sending me date boxes ever since.

## NOT GOING IN BLIND

I get a lot of questions about them, and date boxes in general so I figured I should do an unboxing video to give couples a better idea of what they entail.  I did a quick video below giving you a glimpse into this particular month's box called. "Blind Date" and a few hours later hubby and I actually enjoyed the date ourselves :)  Here's the ONE picture I got of us enjoying it, haha.

(Total disclosure, they sent me the box for free but did not ask me to do a video, I felt like it. Opinions are my own. And yes, some of the links are affiliate links so if you buy a box, I make a small percentage of that.)

## Fav part and awesome announcement

My favorite part about this box, and most date boxes in general: you can recreate the same date in the future! Yes, the cotton candy will be eaten, but you can replace that with your own treat! Everything else can be used again for reinacting the date, doing your own variation, or ya know --  for practical purposes like keeping the blindfold for your next airplane ride or storing the tape in your craft box. I joke, but I'm also serious! I'm both a practical and frugal person so I like knowing that my $42 (which includes shipping) monthly date box investment each month is worth it, and this totally makes it feel even more worth it!

**P.S. Freshly Married will play a small part in the April Date Night In next month, and I'm so excited about it! I can't spoil what it is so I'll just say that I think it's a good theme that any couple can relate to.**
