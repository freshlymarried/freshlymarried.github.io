I've hit the quarter-life mark turning 25 last week and I feel the need to write about it. I have to say that I was not looking forward to this birthday just because the things I was wanting to do /to eat (but for reals!) I couldn't have, or were out of reach. I thought that those things would make me happy. I have to admit that I totally cheated on my birthday and had two slices of cheese pizza that tasted so much like paradise that I didn't even regret the inflammation and discomfort I had from it the next two days! Even though it was #worthit I learned that all those things I wanted might not make me happy in the long run. Needless to say, this birthday brought much contemplation especially reflecting on the past, present, and future.

#### The Past

Since my husband is also 25 in a few months, it is so neat thinking about the 25 years of experiences we have gained so far in our young lives! The past holds so many dear memories, but also unfortunate memories. It also holds so many amazing people we have met along the way, some who have stayed with us to this point.

It's a weird feeling realizing that we have been a part of each other's lives for only 3.5 of those years! Those few years have held some of the most memorable moments of my life, though. Together we have achieved a lot and reached some important goals we have set. I'm grateful that we get to look back at our lives so far and can feel accomplished, independent, smarter, and changed for the better. That's how it truly feels.

#### THE Present

All of those people and all of those experiences have lead me to this point in my life where I feel content, secure, grateful, and excited about the things happening right now. Even if some of those experiences are ones I never thought would happen to me. Example: medical setbacks have dampened my excitement about the plans I had for after college, but I've come to learn that I choose how I let setbacks affect me. I can still do the things I have wanted to do, maybe not on the bigger level that I had hoped but I've still found so much joy in this new life transition I am in. I earned a degree, have explored entrepreneurial interests, and am thinking about all the exciting possibilities that are in front of me! I know people say that a degree doesn't help you much in the real world, and while that may be the case for some career fields, it's a confident feeling seeing that you meet all the requirements/qualifications to apply for a job you have been hoping for.

I have very much been enjoying my time spent at home. I love cleaning our house. I love that I can now keep up on the dishes so well that there is very rarely a pile in the sink from not having time to do them! I love not doing homework at night and instead get to spend stress-free time with my husband. I love running all the errands for us. I love that I am more available to spend time with my family and friends and can actually serve my neighbors. Over the past few months I have struggled at times with being a housewife right now, though I am very capable of having a job. However, it's not like I sit at home eating bon-bons, all day, haha. Like I said, I have some things in the works with my career, but there are also many things with our home and everyday tasks that I didn't realize take up a lot of my time, too.  Am I OK working? YES. I want to. But I also don't want to let the important things get pushed to the back burner again.

#### THE Future

Things might change here in the near future! Who knows? I know that I'm feeling less guilt about having kids right now. Not only do I feel like I gotta take care of my health first, but I realized that we are still young and it's OK to enjoy this time with just us two. Either way it goes with a career, staying at home, or getting pregnant, I know my time is valuable and is going to the right places. That's why I feel optimistic about the future :) I think it took turning 25 to help me feel that way.

On to begin my 26th year!
