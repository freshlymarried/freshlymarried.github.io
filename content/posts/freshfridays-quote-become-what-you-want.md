PROGRESSION!

It's a word that guides every aspect of my life. Especially lately! At some points progress can be slow-moving (one of those points being marriage!) but I know the day will come for you to see the rewards of your efforts and endurance, and you'll feel strong. But it takes your active participation to get there.

**Put in the work to have the marriage you want or you won't get it.**
