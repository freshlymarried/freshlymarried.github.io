Maddie and Jake Topham are newlyweds living in Cedar City, Utah, and have been married for four months. On their story, she said this: "He's my best friend. We went to high school together but back then I didn't think I would marry him. Life took us on different paths for a little while until we met up again a few years later and we were married. We're the happiest we've ever been!"

Maddie has a great way of finding something to learn about marriage that comes from the experiences she has in life, with her family, and with her husband, which is what she does on [her own blog.](http://maddieshappywifelife.weebly.com/blog) That's how I similarly thinkÂ because I'm kind of obsessed with metaphors, object lessons, similies, etc. etc. I believe this kind of attitude helps us grow as individuals and as a couple. So below is her sharing her parents' example that taught her something in her own marriage, as well as her sharing how they keep their marriage fresh!

## Enjoy the Roses

Love is what you go through together. If this phrase is true, my parents are definitely in love. They have gone through so much, but if I had to condense their whole 21 years of marriage to one instance, I would be able to, and I'd pick this one.

One day my dad asked my mom to stick rolls on the grocery list. He was having a lunch meeting at work and was asked to bring rolls as his food assignment. The lunch wasn't until early the following week so my mom told him that she had plenty of time and would love to do that for him. The meeting approached and my mom forgot the rolls. Between driving kids to and from practices or school, cooking, cleaning, working, church callings, and taking care of my dad and the rest of the family, she had forgotten the rolls put on the grocery list the week before. Nobody noticed for a while except my dad.

He didn't bring it up.

Though he had asked my mom kindly, and had given her plenty of time to complete the task, he didn't bring it up. Not even a mention in passing. None of us remembered the rolls. I came home from school for lunch and found a vase of red roses on our kitchen counter. My mom was admiring them when I walked in. I asked her where they came from, and she told me dad had sent them for no reason. I remember how happy she looked. **Not only did my dad not mention the rolls, but he sent roses. It wasn't until a little after the roses had started to wilt that my mom realized her mistake. She felt terrible, but my dad told her not to worry, and enjoy the roses.**

It's often said that every little girl wants to marry someone like their dad. I did. But the part we leave off sometimes is equally important. Every little girl should grow up to love like their mom.

**I've 'forgotten the rolls' in our little relationship over and over. I'm sure there are even more times I haven't realized yet. Jake doesn't bring it up though, he brings roses. I bet that's why I'm so happy.**

## Keeping our marriage fresh

To keep our marriage fresh, Jake and I focus on these little experiences that teach us things and make us happy. Being a newlywed, everything is so unfamiliar and different. My life totally changed when I got married. I feel a little like a kid again. Everything is different and new. The cool thing though is that everything can be celebrated. Every little thing counts as a big win. We find happiness in the tiny moments we have together. We are really happy.
