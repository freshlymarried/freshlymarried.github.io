### Yaaay!

This is a shout out to all you couples reading this: you are an inspiration to us! We have loved hearing about what you have learned in your marriage, and what you are grateful for about your spouse in the _Boast & Brag_ giveaways...and the other readers loved it too! We want to make _Freshly Married_ a place that is not just about my marriage, but where you can share your thoughts and experiences. So, you can now submit your own _Spotlight_ posts on _Freshly Married_ - to share how you keep your marriage fresh! Wooo hoooo!

We want _Freshly Married_ to become a place where couples can join together to learn and share with each other...to fight and conquer the problems we face in marriage. But to do this, we need your help! By submitting a _Spotlight_ post you can help make the world just a little bit better. Even though you aren't perfect, and your marriage isn't perfect, you still have something to share :)

We would like to invite you to either submit your own _Spotlight_ or to invite another couple to submit one:
