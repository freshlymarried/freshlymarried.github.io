The struggles happening to everyone right now all over the world due to the Coronavirus Pandemic is so disheartening. It seems like the toll is being taken so harshly on people emotionally or financially. To try and ease the financial burden just a little bit, along with the stress your relationships might be feeling right now, I would love to give a few lucky couples a chance to win some gift card prizes! I would rather give prizes that help you to have a connecting date night, but this seems to be the best fitting help right now for couples to use as they need. Your quaran-team deserves this!

### A Prize for Your Quaran-team

For this specific contest happening right here on freshlymarried.com, one randomly chosen winner will receive a **$100 _Amazon_ gift card**! You can enter to win in the following super easy ways:

- Comment on this blog post with something you love about your spouse! A quality, personality trait, quirk, or specific experience!

- For a second entry: **In a separate comment**, write down which blog post from Freshly Married has helped your marriage in some way.

This prize is solely sponsored through Freshly Married and not Amazon. Winner understands that gift card will be directly emailed to them.Â The winner will be contacted and must respond by email within 48 hours or forfeit their prize to a runner-up.
