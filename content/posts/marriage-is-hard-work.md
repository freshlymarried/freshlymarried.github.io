When people say that marriage is "hard work" (which it is!), it's important to explain what kind of work that means so newlyweds don't think exhaustion and stress is all they are getting into!

**I think it's hard work because it's a commitment that you've never encountered before.**

Our friends mean so much to all of us. You can't make it in this world without them, right?! But let's be honest, if I have a friend who is too much hard work in keeping up a friendship with, I'll stop putting my time and effort into them, and instead invest in friendships that thrive more easily. But when it comes to a spouse, we cannot think this way!

Marriage begins the same way as does a friendship, continually in situations with another person who has their own thoughts and ways of doing things, but this kind of friendship should not be one to just drop! It requires more effort than any other relationship, in getting through the disagreements and mistakes made.

**It's a hard work that holds much more investment than anything else you'll ever do**.

Your spouse is not just some semester lab partner that you can be rid of after four months! They are a person you truly love, whom you have started a life with emotionally, physically, and spiritually. You have made a family together, you have made plans for the future together, and you've become one unit. Sooooo there's more at stake when it's working at your marriage, right? But that's why I believe this work can feel like some of your greatest achievements when you resolve issues.

This HARD work has the power to bring you closer than ever before, and it totally has done that for my marriage. So don't be afraid of the uncomfortableness, heartache, or disappointment that you might have to get through first because I'm telling you, that hard work will be worth it. :)

What kind of hard work do you feel marriage is? Please share your thoughts!
