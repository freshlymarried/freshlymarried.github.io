Brady and I met through a blind date. It was a Harry Potter party and we dressed up for it. It was so much fun! I loved it. He was the first guy who made me wait for our first kiss, and that showed me that he actually cared about a relationship. He was definitely a keeper. He was the first guy who I was completely myself around. We got married in June of 2012 and we are definitely still in the honeymoon stage.

We keep things fresh in a lot of different ways. He still makes sure to impress me daily by giving me compliments, saying how much he appreciates my cleaning and cooking, and telling me he loves me as much as possible. We honestly say "I love you" more than the average couple per day. When he comes home, he makes sure to say "Hi" to me right away and gives me a hug and a kiss. I make him lunch every day and that is our little amount of time together.

Also, even though it is kind of silly, we make sure we still get a chance to know everything about each other even though we have been together for two years. It is surprising at times because I always expect a certain answer from him but he comes with the opposite sometimes. Also, we keep it fresh the most by keeping our business to ourselves because it keeps our marriage drama-free and we love each other even more. I am so happy with him and I cannot wait until I can look back in fifty years and be happy with my decision that I chose him.

Keeping things fresh,   
The Shocks
