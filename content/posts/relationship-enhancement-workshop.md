I'm suuuuuper excited to announce that I am now a PREP trained facilitator! PREP stands for [Preventative Relationship Enhancement Program.](https://www.prepinc.com/content/About-Us/What-Is-PREP.htm) This accredited program is taught internationally to anyone wanting to strengthen their marital relationship! I have been training so I can teach this curricula to large audiences in the community, and I am happy to announce my first one!

I will be partnered with three co-facilitators to teach a slightly condensed version of the program. We've chosen to hold our workshop in three parts, each being approximately 2.5 hours long. Did you notice it's FREE?! That means you have free access to accredited marriage education! It also means you get refreshments, work book materials, and chances to win fun prizes! For my readers who are in northern Utah, you could definitely come! To register, type in the url in your browser and it will take you to a form to sign up, as well as provide you with more information about the workshop.

I love teaching about  family wellness; it's what I'll be graduating in soon. I hope to incorporate some aspects of what I have learned into the blog, but I sure hope some of you are able to come to this workshop! And if you aren't able to come to this one, stay updated on future PREP workshops I'll hold in the future when I post about them.

As we all know, whether we are newly married, or have been married for 30 years, we can all still learn something new, or at least be reminded of a few things. :) So continue learning about ways to strengthen your marriage!
