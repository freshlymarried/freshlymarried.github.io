### Amy had sinus surgery this week.

I sat worried in the waiting room attempting to get some homework done. After a long wait I  was allowed to go to my wife's bedside in the recovery room as she groggily emerged from the fog of anesthesia.  I was able to help her eat, get dressed, and even use the bathroom...simple things we all take for granted. I held her hand tightly and stared at her beautiful face as she drifted in and out of sleep...quietly thanking God for all of my blessings.

This experience has reminded me that life is crazy! We work to make money, we spend money, we go to school, we eat, we play, we sleep, and then we do it all over again; it is easy to get caught up in the whirlwind of activities...

But today I am extremely grateful that I had the chance to take a step back and remember why I am on this earth and what truly matters to me. I may get stressed at school or work or excited about  a new project or distracted by a new technology or consumed by my goals and to do lists...

But at the end of the day, the gospel and my wife are my true treasures and they will always come first.

Keepin' my priorities fresh, Trevor
