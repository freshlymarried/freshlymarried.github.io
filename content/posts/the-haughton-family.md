My husband Barrett and I have been married for a year now:) and we're sealed together in the Redlands Temple, California. I was a new convert to the Latter-Day Saint church when we started dating, and I'm so grateful to have him in my life! We have both become such stronger people and grown so much. Right now he is attending college and working part- time, and I have a degree in fine arts and am also working.

How we keep our marriage fresh is by having date nights whenever possible ;) It's important to have these wonderful times together to keep our marriage lively and not get lost in the same routines of daily life.

We also try to remember to have fun and humor in our lives, especially when things get rough, which they will. Letting go and communicating to each other are sometimes hard to do, but are essential if we are to live a happy life and have a happy marriage. Faith and forgiveness are key to loving life!!

I love my husband, and love our marriage! There are wonderful times and then there are hard times, but we get through them together and with the help and knowledge that we have our Heavenly Father with us always. And with that, we can get through anything!

Keepin' our marriage fresh,  
The Haughton Family
