### What does it mean when you hold hands with your spouse?

I remember the first time that Amy and I held hands. We had been dating for a few weeks and were really starting to like each other.  I was shy and didn't know how to make any moves. Amy could see that I was struggling so she helped me: we were watching a movie sitting on a bean bag and she put her hand on my arm. I took the hint and immediately grabbed her hand. It felt wonderful. It meant that she wanted to be close to me and that she cared about me.

Holding hands means even more for us today; every time Amy and I reach out and grab hands it says, "Hey, look! I'm not afraid to swallow my pride and let you know that I love you and that I am here for you." I don't know about you but I need that. I need it multiple times a day. I love every chance we have to hold hands: walking, in the car, at the grocery store, at church, watching a movie, while we pray...

Some people might think it is cheesy or silly but I think it wonderful. Holding hands is a way for us to show our love and commitment for each other.

So...don't ever stop holding hands!
