\[caption id="attachment\_1325" align="aligncenter" width="550"\]![married couples, newlywed couples, cute temple marriages, cute married couples, newlywed advice, relationship advice, marriage experiences](images/the-barkers.jpg) Hello! We are the Barkers, Zack and Riley Barker. We have been married for just over a month, some might call us newlyweds.\[/caption\]

Over the past month, we have learned marriage is ........ super fun! We enjoy every second of it, even the more difficult moments. Marriage is like any relationship, the harder you work at it, the more fulfilling and valuable it is. We can honestly say marriage is the best decision we have made. We think of it like a sleepover with your best friend every night. Which it honestly is - wake up, and go to sleep with the one person you are willing to spend ALL your time with.

Keeping our marriage fresh seems to require a lot of secrecy. Not bad secrets, but keeping secrets in order to surprise one another. We really like surprises. Like being blindfolded and driving up Ogden Canyon, Utah to a romantic getaway at the Alaskan Inn.

### Things that have helped our marriage:

- We always have date night every week and that will continue forever.
- Attend our Latter-Day Saint temple as often as possible.
- We have been working really hard to read scriptures daily and we always say our prayers as a couple. Prayers we have got down and scripture study we have been much better at recently.
- The small things really do matter, holding hands, "I Love You's" and random kisses.
- Some other things we have learned, don't isolate yourselves, group dates and married couple friends are the best. Make time for one another, COMMUNICATE, and always be willing to compromise. Work hard but also make sure to play hard.

Some final pieces of advice, save water, shower together. If you must fight do so naked. Put your spouse first and they will do the same. Save yourself some gas money, keep the temperature a little lower and just cuddle up with a blanket. Never stop holding hands! Last but not least, never stop having fun!

Forever newlyweds, The Barkers!
