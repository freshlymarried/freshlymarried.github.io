I don't think I'll ever stop getting inspired by quotes that remind me to look for the lesson through hard times!

If we apply this to marriage, I think the opportunity that #alberteinstein is talking about here are the opportunities to learn something about yourself, your spouse, or the issue.

If our difficulty is disagreeing on something important, I get the chance to see another perspective I didn't see before. I also get the chance to analyze myself and how I can improve.

I think ultimately, difficult times are ALWAYS opportunities to grow. Thatâ€™s what it comes down to.
