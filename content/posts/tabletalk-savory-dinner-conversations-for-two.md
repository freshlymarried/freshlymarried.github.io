How many times do we eat dinner together at home in front of the television, without saying much to each other? We are pretty good at having conversations, but I can't count how many times we've still done this. :) It's easy to do when we just have the two of us, and we just want to escape from the tasks and stress of the day. Am I right? But it's important to have conversations together! Not just about how your day went, but conversation that connects you on a deeper level.

The importance of having dinner conversations is why I’m so excited to finally share this date box as it’s my first box as a contributor to [Date Night In Box](https://frstre.com/go/?a=19136-4863f8&s=110370-e6b059&tap_s=110370-e6b059)! The creative minds over there at DNIB felt that there should be even more opportunities for couples to connect, so they created a new section of the date called #TableTalk in conjunction with the dinner portion! #Tabletalk is a short article that corresponds with the theme of each box and provides talking points of conversation for you and your partner!

This "Aloha" themed box from July is the first date I got to do the #TableTalk insert for, and I'm so happy with how it turned out! I don't want to share what that entire portion said, but I want to help you understand how this coordinates with the theme, with dating each other and enhancing your relationship!

Marina from [Marina Makes](https://marinamakesblog.com/) created a menu that was so tropical and tantalizing that I knew I needed to create a conversation that went right with it. So I did :) Oddly enough, it includes a Wendy's reference of dipping fries in the chocolate frosty as well as some questions that make you think deeper about your relationship and what makes it sweet and savory :)

## Food for thought when it comes to date boxes

I know that planned dates are not everyone’s cup of tea. I mean, spontaneity is great! I encourage you to do spontaneous dates in your marriage! **But if you and your partner are too good at not spending this important quality time together on a regular basis, then it’s time you scheduled it. It’s time you let someone else schedule it for you, provide you with the activity, provide you with an enjoyable night, and provide you with an opportunity to CONNECT with your partner!**

I've heard someone say before, _“I could have bought these items myself for cheaper and then did the date ourselves.”_ But my response: _“You didn’t though, and you most likely won’t.”_ Someone else has done the activity coordinating, purchasing, packaging, and is even sending it to your door! Let them do this for your marriage.
