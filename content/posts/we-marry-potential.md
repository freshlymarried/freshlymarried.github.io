This is a humbling reminder on marriage that I truly appreciate.

When we look at our spouses, we should view them with a sense of compassion, recognizing that they have weaknesses just like you do. And then I hope that compassion turns into excitement thinking about how great your marriage can be; how it can improve and strengthen.

### Your spouse has potential, your marriage has potential.
