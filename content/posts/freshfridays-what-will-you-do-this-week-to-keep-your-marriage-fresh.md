**This #freshfridays question gives you SEVEN DAYS to find a good time to do something for your spouse or for your marriage in general!** I'm going to give my husband more head/scalp massages this week because he has really liked those lately. I've noticed it helps him to de-stress from work and even go to sleep more easily. :) Think about what you could do and commit to do it!
