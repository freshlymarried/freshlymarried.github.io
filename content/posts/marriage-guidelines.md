We love it when we come across marriage being talked about in the news. This [article](http://www.deseretnews.com/article/865589051/The-10-marriage-commandments-How-to-make-daily-choices-to-love-your-spouse.html) is something that was posted in the Deseret Newspaper in Salt Lake City, Utah, the other day, and I just wanted to share it.

Though I’m not sure that I agree with titling these “marriage commandments,” I do think it’s a great suggestion to **_compare_** them to the ten commandments we have been taught about through the gospel.

As I remember each time I have been taught the ten commandments, or other church guidelines, I am reminded that we will not perfectly keep all of these throughout our lifetime. The only person who did that, was our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We will never be that perfect, but should always strive to meet that standard, because our effort is what he expects of us.

### What effort do our spouses expect of us?

I think we can strive to achieve this same standard in our marriages. Just like we work on strengthening our spirituality, we can work on strengthening our marriages. Every once in awhile, I pick an aspect of my spirituality that seems to be lacking, and I work on it, bringing it better up to par. Maybe the best thing to do is to pick one of these marriage guidelines that you could be better at, and strive to reach the standard that your spouse is expecting of you.

The picture above, was the wedding present Trevor gave me the night before we got married. I love these promises, and it's so great to have this daily reminder of the kind of spouse we want and should be.
