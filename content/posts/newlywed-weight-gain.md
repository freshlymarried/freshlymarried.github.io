Did any other couples gain weight their first months of year of marriage? Or was it just us? hahaha. We always joke to people that getting married must do something to your metabolism. Maybe we just didn't start off our marriage eating healthy in the first place. I mean, we took this whole first tier of our wedding cake with us on our honeymoon to eat! haha I guess some of our eating habits changed when we got married vs. the single life and even when we dated and were engaged. Trevor also married a girl who likes to have boxes of brownie mixes on hand ;) There's probably multiple factors that went into our weight gain, but it doesn't change that it happened! So we have been working on losing that weight. :)

You know how everyone makes the jokes about new year's resolutions to lose weight? There are so many out there because a lot of people will make the goal but they give up. I've made a goal about my health every year, but it's mostly been about eating healthier, or exercising, not necessarily focused on losing weight; until last year. I had never been as heavy as I was.  Weight became a struggle for both Trevor and I, so we made a goal on December 31st, 2013, that we would lose \_\_\_ pounds in 2014. We made goals and I think mine was to lose 25 pounds. Well, I am proud to say I achieved that goal by losing 27 pounds! While I'm happy to be able to fit into jeans that are 2-3 pant sizes smaller, I am not really happy with how and why I lost my weight.

#### The story, the problem, and the answer

In the past, I've always been able to either lose weight, or maintain my weight if I put my mind to it. However, I quickly found out that was not working for me because my appetite was much stronger than my mind! It took a lot for me to feel full, and I craved bread, and treatsies more than I ever have. I was having some other noticeably off health problems, so we determined that there must be something going on. I went to the doctor first week of January and ended up with a diagnosis for Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). My doctor put me on metformin to help my body process sugars better, and I've been taking it ever since.

The medication came with some great outcomes. My appetite for one, was not as crazy (huge blessing!). I also lost weight of course. All of that's great but I don't like what it cost me. It cost me weeks of nausea, and vomiting. It cost me long days of meal indecision because just the thought of some foods made me sick. This has lead to some annoying food aversions towards some of my (once) favorite meals. :( Bummer, right?! And I also didn't like that because of my aversions, Trevor suffered from his favorite meals being depraved, too! Again, big bummer.

#### Focusing on the future

Some people say I should still be proud that I look great and that my body is on a healthier track. I'm working on that happy and proud idea! But man, it's just been a long and difficult experience for me; physically, mentally, and even spiritually. I could say a lot more about it, especially because I know many women struggle with PCOS, but I don't want to share all the details of that experience so publicly, especially because it covers the possibility of infertility. However, if you are struggling with a similar situation like mine and want to ask me more or just talk about it, you are more than welcome to email me! (I know how helpful and/or comforting it can be to talk about it with others who also have PCOS) But for here on our blog, I don't want to focus on all the negatives in the past in this situation, but instead focus on the positive outlook that comes with the future. That's what a new year is about, right?

Trevor and I are both working towards this goal of eating healthier. We are excited to do it together, even though we both have a few different dietary needs and desires. It's hard to create meal plans with situations like this, so if anyone has tips, please let me know! And I'll do an update in the future of our experience!
