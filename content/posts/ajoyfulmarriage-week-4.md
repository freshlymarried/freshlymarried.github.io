I feel like a lot of things this week have been telling me "No."

It's a lot of things that have to do with my physical health mainly, but a few other things as well. Circumstantial things that just happen in the week like having to make two special trips to the grocery store for strawberries, on two different days, and both stores just happen to be completely out of strawberries! (How does that even happen? haha) I get that there are worse things than the store not having an ingredient you need, but having something as little and yet so annoying as this happen at the end of the week just kinda makes a girl feel defeated.

The Joy I found in my marriage this week, is that even though so many aspects of life this week said, _"Nope! Not today, Amy!"_ my husband lifted me up by saying things like, "We'll figure it out" "I'll go with you" "I'll do that for you" "We can do it" and "Let's not worry about the strawberries" haha. He expressed empathy, helpfulness, kindness, and service. He reminds me of our blessings, that even though our trials right now are about our physical health, we are grateful to have comfortable financial means to help take care of those issues. He may not have the power to grant me a whole bunch of yes's to cancel out all those no's, but he made things sound possible, and hopeful.

As long as we have that kind of support for one another, facing things together, we can feel strength through these trials. As cheesy as this might sound, through hard times, we can give our marriage the hopeful shining sun rays like the one in the picture :)
