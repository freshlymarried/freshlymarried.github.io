My husband and I met when we were out at a club dancing. To be honest, I thought he was a bit creepy at first, but by the end of the night I started to really like him. I ended up giving him my number, and the next day we went out for lunch together. It was the most amazing date I ever had! We had so much in common, and he was so funny! Things just took off from there, and a year and a half later we got married.

My husband and I try to keep our marriage fresh by spending alone time together. My husband works long hours, so before bed we try and spend at least 10-15 minutes to just talk and enjoy one another. We also bought a massage table online, and learned how to massage one another. It is the most amazing way for us to connect because it is healthy for our bodies, as well as it is extremely intimate! We also try and dress up fancy and go out places at least once a month since most days we just wear casual clothing.

Keepin' it fresh,Â
