**We have been feeling some joy this past week and I'm not quite sure how to sum it up** into **one word, but I think it could be summarized into patience and clarity.**

**Patience usually is not a joyous word, haha, but it is when you have achieved patience, right**? Well this weekend we got a new car! It's one I've been eyeing for awhile now and even test-drove it over a year ago. We've just been waiting for the right timing and that patience paid off because we were able to get it at a great deal with a very low monthly-payment :) I feel so blessed that we were able to get it! Now I'm ready for that "mom car" status lol.

**Which brings me to our next joy of clarity.** We were able to see a fertility specialist this week after months of me putting it off in intimidation and overwhelm. And I'm so very glad we did. It's amazing how much more we were able to find out about what's going on and feeling the truly specialized care they give. It's all they focus on and so we feel like we are in good hands. We've made a tedious plan of action and hopefully, that will lead us to conceive a child of our own soon :)

These are two different joys, but they have left me with this underlying feeling that life truly can go your way sometimes and that you should celebrate those, even if it's just for a moment. There are many situations in life that don't go our way and we are left feeling disappointed, defeated, confused, frustrated, or envious. So I'm holding onto these two moments right now so gratefully, humbly, and joyfully.
