I'm almost half way through this project to live a more joyful marriage! It's been such a good exercise for me to do each week because sometimes I have to think a little harder about the joys in life and in marriage. And that has helped me see things deeper in our relationship.

**There have been a few things in our marriage this week that** **has brought me joy! :) But one main thing that I have found joy in this week was in our ultimate cereal date night on Friday!** We haven't had cereals we enjoy in like over a year or two so it was a unique idea for us! And while we ate all these fav cereals of ours, we tried out a new TV show, _The Good Place_, which has been funny. It was the perfect chill date night for us with us having allergy colds and Trevor starting his new job.

The thing I liked about this was that we came up with this idea like two weeks ago when we started talking about all the special cereals that came out when we were growing up. And it turned into this 20-minute conversation of our favorite healthy and non-healthy cereals, which special edition cereals were still around, and childhood stories of why we love these cereals. Which turned into this idea that we should just get a whole bunch of cereals we love or haven't had in years, and just eat them while watching a movie or something. :) Hence, why this was our date night this week :)

This could seem insignificant to people, but these are the conversations that drive your connection with each other. And so many couples look for these ways to connect better. I think the reason we were able to start this random conversation on cereal that lead to such a fun and yummy date night, was partly because we have been using that list of [100 conversational questions to ask your spouse](https://freshlymarried.com/100-conversational-questions-to-ask-your-spouse/) the past two months. Not trying to make a plug for this list I created, I'm just being honest. I think because we periodically asked each other these questions that turned into interesting discussions, we trained our brains to ask our own random questions like these. Or maybe it's just trained our brains to focus less on the serious questions that so often influence us negatively.

Whichever answer it is, or maybe it's both, I'm joyous about it :)

_P.S. It's never too late to join in on this project yourself! Look for at least one joy in your marriage each week and write it down in your journal, or share it on social media with the hashtag_ #ajoyfulmarriage !Â _It may inspire those around you to look more positively at their own marriages, too!_
