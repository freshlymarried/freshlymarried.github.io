What’s a “White Elephant” gift? It’s a silly gag gift usually for playing a White Elephant game!
How does it work? There&rsquo;s a pile of gifts, one per person who is playing. Everyone draws a number which decides the order they choose a gift from the pile. If you have 13 people/13 gifts, you’ll have numbers 1-13 to draw from. Starting with person #1, they will choose a gift from the pile to unwrap and reveal to everyone.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-37/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 37</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The joy I found in my marriage this week: cute banter :) We love being silly with each other, just like any other couple!

Whenever I give my husband a piece of gum, he ALWAYS gives me the wrapper, haha.

It&rsquo;s a good feeling when both of you notice that your interactions and overall days feel different from the past few months. I think one of the biggest things that we both appreciated and found joy in was how we focused more on &ldquo;listening to understand&rdquo; when we discussed specific subjects. I&rsquo;ve always known this principle but sometimes you just need to be reminded, right?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-real-love-your-spouse-challenge/ class="link black dim">The Real 'Love Your Spouse' Challenge</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;282060156&rdquo; ]
So I got nominated to do that &lsquo;Love Your Spouse&rsquo; Challenge, but I&rsquo;m not going to do it. It might be surprising since I&rsquo;m a huge advocate of marriage, and that I totally admire this challenge going around! It&rsquo;s important to publically share your feelings about your spouse, acknowledge their talents and how they have influenced your marriage, etc. But I think there can be TOO much of that sometimes.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/object-lessons-the-marriage-recipe/ class="link black dim">Object Lessons: The Marriage Recipe</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Watch the video, then proceed to the rest of the post below :)

Making your own marriage recipe So you have your ingredients list above, and now you need the directions to follow, but where do you find those directions to follow? 3 ways you find those directions:
You study and learn through credible books, classes, and advice from others.

Well this opportunity, he knew it was coming after he created the perfect set up, so he said it before I could say it.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/golden-bunnies/ class="link black dim">The Easter Bunny</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I remember reading an article last month on Huffington Post called, &ldquo;Can We Bring The Holidays Down A Notch?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a Mom telling about the stress that she feels comes with Holidays while feeling pressure from other moms who seem to make each holiday bigger than the last. I&rsquo;m not a mom with kids who sometimes need to be pampered with gifts on holidays, but as a newlywed, I can relate to feeling that pressure as well.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/couch-potatoes/ class="link black dim">Couch Potatoes</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The past three weeks, Trevor and I have felt like we&rsquo;ve been bums, couch potatoes, or whatever you call it. I am just finishing a cold I have had for the past 3 weeks, so I haven&rsquo;t had much energy to workout, or do extra things beyond the necessary chores. I&rsquo;ve mostly been tired, while Trevor has also been tired from some adjustments in his new job. While he loves it, his brain can be on overload sometimes.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/cereal-its-whats-for-dinner/ class="link black dim">Cereal: It's What's For Dinner</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I didn&rsquo;t think I would come across this dilemma so soon after marriage. I thought we were pretty great at this, and wouldn&rsquo;t struggle with it as much as we have been lately. It&rsquo;s something that I thought I might have a hard time with when we have kids, but nope. It&rsquo;s already a struggle at 9 months of marriage.
What is this problem, you ask? Meals. Yeah I thought you might laugh.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/365-date-night-ideas/ class="link black dim">365 Date Night Ideas</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Let&rsquo;s be honest here. Every now and then, date nights can get a little routine doing the same things we usually do. This happens with us newlyweds too, believe it or not! So new ideas for date nights are good to have on those nights we feel like being spontaneous, or just wanting to do something different. Well, this is an idea that you can do any day of the week, in any season.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/national-old-stuff-day/ class="link black dim">National Old Stuff Day</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">My twenty-second year was the best year of my life.
Yesterday, I told Trevor my feelings on this past birthday year, and how I think it&rsquo;s going to be hard to top. He said, &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that! We are together, so every year is going to get better and better.&rdquo; I loved it. I think trials are bound to happen in the years ahead of us, because there is so much more that we get to, and need to experience.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/some-peoples-kids/ class="link black dim">Some People's Kids</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We aren’t quite sure about how many kids we will want to have, when the time comes. The funny part is that Trevor wants two, and I think that I like three! What’s even more funny is that every now and then, we come across a scene that could give us a great reason to want as few kids as possible, haha. And when that happens, Trevor just holds up 2 fingers at me, and smiles.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/dentist-dilemma/ class="link black dim">Dentist Dilemma</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Our dear, dear parents have paid for full insurances on our health, dental, and vision care all our lives&mldr; Until now.
We’ve been getting our dental work in this summer, while we have insurance through Trevor’s company, and WOW! What a confusing puzzle insurance is. I never knew everything that goes into making sure you don’t pay a million dollars for small medical services. I mean, just in choosing a dentist, you have to carefully choose a great dentist, while also double-checking that they carry your insurance.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/preparing-for-the-zombie-apocalypse/ class="link black dim">Preparing For The Zombie Apocalypse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">You don’t hear about many newlywed couples who have food storage, but we are now one of those couples. We’ve been planning since before we got married, to have a three-month supply of food storage, and we just reached that goal this week. No, this isn’t because we worry that a zombie apocalypse will occur. It’s because we fear the unknown.
I know many of you think that the topic of food storage is one that older people are involved in.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/note-to-self/ class="link black dim">Note To Self</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Remember to cut the price tag off of your brand new blouse before you wear it to Sacrament meeting, in giving a talk at the pulpit, in front of a large congregation.
It’s fine. My husband slyly pulled it off after I sat back down.
Well, the time came, sooner than I had expected, that we were asked to speak in Sacrament meeting. To many of you, this may surprise you, but we actually enjoyed it.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-iron-2/ class="link black dim">The Iron</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We just bought a new iron two weeks ago. I was excited to play wifey with it, and iron things for my husband, just like the movies show wives and moms doing. (some of you might chuckle at that). So while Trevor went to run errands, I thought I would try it out on his dress shirts, and have them wrinkle-free for his Sunday-dress.
You need to know two things before you judge me.</div></div></div></div></section></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.github.io>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
