Our military does so much for us, along with their spouses! And sometimes they don&rsquo;t get the gratitude or appreciation they deserve, because we may not fully understand what they experience in their day to day life. We may not realize how differently they have to work their marriage and their family because of the long-distances and demands that are asked of them.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/spotlight-learning-from-a-parents-divorce-part-1/ class="link black dim">Spotlight: Learning From a Parents' Divorce (Part 1)</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A divorce is an event that affects so many people and for years to come. It’s something very common, yet it’s very scary to talk about for many people. It’s a topic I’ve been wanting to tackle for awhile, but contains so many aspects to cover. I&rsquo;ve always been curious about how children, adolescents, and adult children have been affected by their parents&rsquo; divorce. So I&rsquo;ve enlisted the help of some amazing women who are kind enough to share their experiences with you, to give you better insight into this particular family situation.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/spotlight-learning-from-a-parents-divorce-part-2/ class="link black dim">Spotlight: Learning From a Parents' Divorce (Part 2)</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">If you didn’t catch part 1 reading some great insight and advice from both Brooke and Kristin, you should go read that! I asked them to share what their parents’ divorce was like on them at age 13, and how they navigate the effects of that divorce currently, now that they are married themselves.
This Spotlight Part 2 perspective is getting some insight from two women who were adults and married or almost married when their parents got a divorce.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/spotlight-the-unique-marriage-of-living-with-mental-illness/ class="link black dim">Spotlight: The Unique Marriage of Living With Mental Illness</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The times when I think marriage can get the toughest is when spouses are not sharing the same viewpoint, or when one spouse is struggling physically or mentally. Both of these tough situations are prevalent in a marriage that has one or both spouses struggling with mental illness. As I&rsquo;ve shared in a few articles on depression, it&rsquo;s not easy for either spouse to handle, and it truly can affect your marriage in the short-term AND long-term of your relationship.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/spotlight-making-marriage-a-priority-through-challenging-times/ class="link black dim">Spotlight: Making Marriage a Priority Through Challenging Times</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Introduction: Amberly of A Prioritized Marriage, is someone I absolutely look up to when it comes to marriage!

She gives great responses that not only demonstrate her important message of making the relationship with your spouse a priority, but she shares specific actions on how to do that.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/spotlight-absence-makes-the-heart-grow-fonder/ class="link black dim">Spotlight: Absence Makes the Heart Grow Fonder</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Introduction How many people can say one of their close childhood friends are in a band; a SUCCESSFUL band at that?! I&rsquo;m lucky enough to have her examples in my life of going after your dreams while being a wife and a parent, which is not easy to balance, as many of us know!
Because of the frequent traveling between the two of them, she has learned what helps to keep their marriage fresh through the distance and gives great advice on how they have managed that.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/spotlight-enjoy-the-roses/ class="link black dim">Spotlight: Enjoy the Roses</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Maddie and Jake Topham are newlyweds living in Cedar City, Utah, and have been married for four months. On their story, she said this: &ldquo;He&rsquo;s my best friend. We went to high school together but back then I didn&rsquo;t think I would marry him.

She also shared the very personal and difficult challenges of battling severe Postpartum Depression and how she plans to handle that with their third baby on the way.

Obviously, they have to go through years of medical school in order to get there, making it a long process, especially when you&rsquo;re married. Since there are many spouses who can relate to this situation, I turned to my amazing friend Raquel to give some inspiration and encouragement in this area.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/fire-wife-life/ class="link black dim">Fire-Wife Life</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">As we all know, there are different kinds of marital experiences! A few that I have received better insight into this year are marriages that have a spouse serving in the armed forces, police work, firefighters, or EMT&rsquo;s. Because of their job description and the sacrifice they make to help protect us, they face different challenges in their marriages than other couples might face. Since I do not have first-hand experience in this area, I asked someone who has absolute experience in this to help us understand better.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/defending-motherhood/ class="link black dim">Defending Motherhood</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Pregnancy.

In reality, she was always those things, but I&rsquo;ve never been one to claim that High School Seniors were geniuses.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-acker-family/ class="link black dim">The Acker Family</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_1418&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;450&rdquo;] Hello, We are the Acker’s![/caption]
In the short time we have been married, we have learned so much about marriage and about each other. One important thing that I have learned is COMPROMISE!! Compromise is so important, especially if you and your husband have different interests, like Josh and I do.
When Josh and I got married, we promised each other we would not be the stereotypical American couple that ends up in a divorce court in 5 years.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-barker-family/ class="link black dim">The Barker Family</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[caption id=&ldquo;attachment_1325&rdquo; align=&ldquo;aligncenter&rdquo; width=&ldquo;550&rdquo;] Hello! We are the Barkers, Zack and Riley Barker. We have been married for just over a month, some might call us newlyweds.[/caption]
Over the past month, we have learned marriage is &mldr;&mldr;.. super fun! We enjoy every second of it, even the more difficult moments. Marriage is like any relationship, the harder you work at it, the more fulfilling and valuable it is. We can honestly say marriage is the best decision we have made.</div></div></div></div></section></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.github.io>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
