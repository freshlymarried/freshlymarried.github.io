It seems like the toll is being taken so harshly on people emotionally or financially. To try and ease the financial burden just a little bit, along with the stress your relationships might be feeling right now, I would love to give a few lucky couples a chance to win some gift card prizes!</description></item><item><title>Prize Contest Celebrating Video Course!</title><link>https://freshlymarried.com/prize-contest-celebrating-video-course/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.com/prize-contest-celebrating-video-course/</guid><description>The day before I came down with a nasty influenza I announced my video course: “How to Navigate Your Differences.” I also said that to celebrate I was going to do an awesome giveaway prize, and then… well the flu. Haha. And then it was my birthday so here we are now!
I just want to say that I have been so excited about this video course, because it&amp;rsquo;s so applicable for ALL marriages, no matter what stage you are in, or how deep your problems are!</description></item><item><title>Freshly Married 4-Year Anniversary Giveaway!</title><link>https://freshlymarried.com/freshly-married-4-year-anniversary-giveaway/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 Jun 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.com/freshly-married-4-year-anniversary-giveaway/</guid><description>HAPPY FOUR YEARS! Four years ago today, I wrote my very first blog post on Freshly Married, called &amp;ldquo;The Iron,&amp;rdquo; about a lesson I learned with an iron (obviously), that taught me what it truly means to be a good wife, even though I had only been married for a few short weeks. Though we&amp;rsquo;ve been married for longer now and have had several more tough experiences than this one, this iron experience helped launch the message behind Freshly Married, which you can read more about here.</description></item><item><title>Taking Responsibility For Your Sexuality</title><link>https://freshlymarried.com/taking-responsibility-for-your-sexuality/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.com/taking-responsibility-for-your-sexuality/</guid><description>*This post contains affiliate links.
I think one of the biggest hangups a couple can have when it comes to their sex life is not understanding their own sexuality first. It makes me sad that so many married people don’t even understand this huge part of their life and who they are. Which is like, the basis of a satisfying sex life for both husband and wife!
Why it&amp;rsquo;s important SOOOO I want to talk just a little bit about this.</description></item><item><title>Wife Life T-shirt Giveaway on Instagram</title><link>https://freshlymarried.com/wife-life-t-shirt-giveaway-on-instagram/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.com/wife-life-t-shirt-giveaway-on-instagram/</guid><description>I’ve been wanting to do some exciting things for the #monthoflove, which means GIVEAWAYS!

Many of our summer nights lately have consisted of take-out dinner. Somehow it&amp;rsquo;s mostly Mexican food, too, which means Cafe Rio :) We like going to the restaurant itself occasionally but sometimes we are just too pooped from the day, and just want to eat it at home while we watch Monk :) Know what I&amp;rsquo;m saying?! There&amp;rsquo;s been a big question apparently of what the masses prefer: their new Spicy Green Chile Pork, or their classic Sweet Pork.</description></item><item><title>Instax Mini Camera Giveaway</title><link>https://freshlymarried.com/instax-mini-camera-giveaway/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.com/instax-mini-camera-giveaway/</guid><description>***Giveaway closed.*** Winner listed at the bottom of the post *This post contains affiliate links.
This week my focus is on the importance of recording the memories in marriage! I talk about how important it is to journal the little details here, with 10 ideas for how you can do that! I also wrote here about how important it is to update your family photos often AND make sure to hang them up in your house!</description></item><item><title>#freshdatenights Giveaway: $75 Amazon Gift Card!</title><link>https://freshlymarried.com/freshdatenights-giveaway-75-amazon-gift-card/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.com/freshdatenights-giveaway-75-amazon-gift-card/</guid><description>I had a good luck charm apparently for this St. Patricks Day because I &amp;ldquo;won&amp;rdquo; some amazing seats to the Jazz game that night! I say &amp;ldquo;won&amp;rdquo; because an old friend couldn&amp;rsquo;t use them so they did a little drawing for people interested and I got them :) What&amp;rsquo;s better than a fun date night to an NBA game? A FREE ONE, haha. It was double-y awesome because Trevor and I had never been to a game together yet.</description></item><item><title>February Date Night Giveaway Winner</title><link>https://freshlymarried.com/february-date-night-giveaway-winner/</link><pubDate>Tue, 09 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.com/february-date-night-giveaway-winner/</guid><description>For this giveaway, I asked you to tell us how you keep your marriage fresh, along with reposting a freshly married quote from our insta. I truly loved reading the responses from those who participated!
A response that was similar among multiple entries was that they try to keep each other a priority among new situations like having babies. Other responses were back to the simple basics: making dinner together, having weekly date nights, dancing in the kitchen, and other quality time activities :) I just really liked hearing these responses because not only do they inspire my own marriage, but those who saw your posts were also inspired!</description></item><item><title>Superbowl $50 Date Night Giveaway</title><link>https://freshlymarried.com/superbowl-50-date-night-giveaway/</link><pubDate>Mon, 08 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.com/superbowl-50-date-night-giveaway/</guid><description>Do you guys know Stuart Edge? My husband and I just recently found his uplifting videos on youtube and every time I watch them I think, &amp;ldquo;How cool is it that he can just give away money in really neat ways and make people happy?! I wish I could do that!&amp;rdquo; Well I&amp;rsquo;m definitely not made of money but I genuinely love doing nice things for people, especially if it truly does help them in some way.</description></item><item><title>Winner of the Valentine's Giveaway</title><link>https://freshlymarried.com/winner-of-the-valentines-giveaway/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Feb 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.com/winner-of-the-valentines-giveaway/</guid><description>Thank you to everyone who entered the giveaway.

I used to give little cheesy valentines to my friends and family, but I have since upgraded to legit 5x7 Cards that are decked out with cutesy embellishments and hand-written words of love. I also love seeing baked goods decorated in pinks and reds, with jimmy sprinkles all over! And furthermore, I love decorating baked goods myself&amp;ndash; heart shapes and everything!</description></item><item><title>Winner Winner, Chicken Dinner</title><link>https://freshlymarried.com/winner-winner-chicken-dinner/</link><pubDate>Mon, 19 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.com/winner-winner-chicken-dinner/</guid><description>Well folks, we have drawn a name out of the hat, with a winner to announce for our Boast and Brag Giveaway!
