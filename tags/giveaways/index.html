I just want to say that I have been so excited about this video course, because it&rsquo;s so applicable for ALL marriages, no matter what stage you are in, or how deep your problems are!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshly-married-4-year-anniversary-giveaway/ class="link black dim">Freshly Married 4-Year Anniversary Giveaway!</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">HAPPY FOUR YEARS! Four years ago today, I wrote my very first blog post on Freshly Married, called &ldquo;The Iron,&rdquo; about a lesson I learned with an iron (obviously), that taught me what it truly means to be a good wife, even though I had only been married for a few short weeks. Though we&rsquo;ve been married for longer now and have had several more tough experiences than this one, this iron experience helped launch the message behind Freshly Married, which you can read more about here.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/taking-responsibility-for-your-sexuality/ class="link black dim">Taking Responsibility For Your Sexuality</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links.
I think one of the biggest hangups a couple can have when it comes to their sex life is not understanding their own sexuality first. It makes me sad that so many married people don’t even understand this huge part of their life and who they are. Which is like, the basis of a satisfying sex life for both husband and wife!
Why it&rsquo;s important SOOOO I want to talk just a little bit about this.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/wife-life-t-shirt-giveaway-on-instagram/ class="link black dim">Wife Life T-shirt Giveaway on Instagram</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I’ve been wanting to do some exciting things for the #monthoflove, which means GIVEAWAYS!

Since summer is officially over, I wanted to cheer us up with a giveaway! I am giving away TWO of my &ldquo;Wife Life is The Best Life&rdquo; t-shirts! Woot woot! We know ya&rsquo;ll want to rock this shirt right now.

Many of our summer nights lately have consisted of take-out dinner. Somehow it&rsquo;s mostly Mexican food, too, which means Cafe Rio :) We like going to the restaurant itself occasionally but sometimes we are just too pooped from the day, and just want to eat it at home while we watch Monk :) Know what I&rsquo;m saying?! There&rsquo;s been a big question apparently of what the masses prefer: their new Spicy Green Chile Pork, or their classic Sweet Pork.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/instax-mini-camera-giveaway/ class="link black dim">Instax Mini Camera Giveaway</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">***Giveaway closed.*** Winner listed at the bottom of the post *This post contains affiliate links.
This week my focus is on the importance of recording the memories in marriage! I talk about how important it is to journal the little details here, with 10 ideas for how you can do that! I also wrote here about how important it is to update your family photos often AND make sure to hang them up in your house!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/#freshdatenights-giveaway-75-amazon-gift-card/ class="link black dim">#freshdatenights Giveaway: $75 Amazon Gift Card!</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I had a good luck charm apparently for this St. Patricks Day because I &ldquo;won&rdquo; some amazing seats to the Jazz game that night! I say &ldquo;won&rdquo; because an old friend couldn&rsquo;t use them so they did a little drawing for people interested and I got them :) What&rsquo;s better than a fun date night to an NBA game? A FREE ONE, haha. It was double-y awesome because Trevor and I had never been to a game together yet.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/february-date-night-giveaway-winner/ class="link black dim">February Date Night Giveaway Winner</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">For this giveaway, I asked you to tell us how you keep your marriage fresh, along with reposting a freshly married quote from our insta. I truly loved reading the responses from those who participated!
A response that was similar among multiple entries was that they try to keep each other a priority among new situations like having babies. Other responses were back to the simple basics: making dinner together, having weekly date nights, dancing in the kitchen, and other quality time activities :) I just really liked hearing these responses because not only do they inspire my own marriage, but those who saw your posts were also inspired!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/superbowl-50-date-night-giveaway/ class="link black dim">Superbowl $50 Date Night Giveaway</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Do you guys know Stuart Edge?
