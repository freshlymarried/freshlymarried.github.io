The idea of sharing your hopes and dreams as individuals and as a couple is so meaningful to a relationship! There are so many positives it brings to your life because it’s a very hopeful concept.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/my-words-of-the-year/ class="link black dim">My Words of The Year</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Now that the secret is out that I’m pregnant with twins I can finally share my words of the year because it has everything to do with them. :) I say WORDS because I think it&rsquo;s important to have a goal in mind for you as an individual, and then a goal in mind for your marriage. However you like to do your goals, whether by choosing a specific word to inspire you, a vision board, or simply writing down the goal in a sentence, make sure you are considering how you can strengthen your marriage.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/tabletalk-savory-dinner-conversations-for-two/ class="link black dim">#TableTalk -- Savory Dinner Conversations for Two</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">***This article contains affiliate links so if you purchase, I make a small percentage of that.
How many times do we eat dinner together at home in front of the television, without saying much to each other? We are pretty good at having conversations, but I can&rsquo;t count how many times we&rsquo;ve still done this. :) It&rsquo;s easy to do when we just have the two of us, and we just want to escape from the tasks and stress of the day.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/50-gift-ideas-for-your-spouse/ class="link black dim">50 Gift Ideas for Your Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Every birthday, Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and wedding anniversary, I find myself googling thoughtful gift ideas that I can buy or make for my spouse.

Add these up and we’ve got AT LEAST 5 times throughout the year searching for gift ideas.
Over the past few years, I have been keeping track of some awesome finds that interest me or my spouse, and I think most spouses would love too.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/why-your-spouse-wont-be-your-everything/ class="link black dim">Why Your Spouse Won't Be Your Everything</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I was watching an awesome TED talk from Belgian Psychotherapist, Esther Perel about desire in committed relationships.

She talks about how as humans we have two fundamental human needs that conflict with each other when we are in a committed relationship.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/unboxing-video-blind-date-from-date-night-in/ class="link black dim">Unboxing Video: "Blind Date" from Date Night In</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Date boxes have been a new thing the past few years, and I think are recently gaining more traction for couples, especially those with busy lives. Last year my husband and I experimented with date boxes to see what they are all about, and to see if they would give us added fun in our marriage :)
I wrote an article on how date boxes work, so if you&rsquo;re not familiar with the concept, check that out.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-36/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 36</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This joy is going to AGAIN sound familiar&mldr; trying new things together, or just things that we grew up doing but haven&rsquo;t done since we&rsquo;ve been together.
We went to a little Idaho getaway with family this weekend and had a blast doing a whole bunch of outdoorsy adventurous things we haven&rsquo;t yet experienced together, like riding on four-wheelers,fishing and shooting. It&rsquo;s weird that in our 5 years of being together, 4 years of that in marriage, we haven&rsquo;t done these things yet, even though both of our families are outdoor sports adventurists.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/4-mistakes-we-make-when-a-friends-marriage-is-struggling/ class="link black dim">4 Mistakes We Make When a Friend’s Marriage is Struggling</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">It’s not easy to see your friends go through hard struggles, especially when it comes to such an important relationship like marriage. It’s also not easy to be the confidant, the person they choose to share their marital struggles with.

Back in the dating life, I knew a few girls who would shy away from dating guys who played video games, simply because they instantly thought of it associated with a lazy, preoccupied husband. I have to admit that I dated a guy who played video games and at times I felt second to him because of it.

Making your own marriage recipe So you have your ingredients list above, and now you need the directions to follow, but where do you find those directions to follow? 3 ways you find those directions:
You study and learn through credible books, classes, and advice from others.

The idea of growing apart happens gradually over time. When you think about it, there will always be sudden situations that come up where you do need to be there for your kids over your spouse, but I think the problem starts when this is happening frequently.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-married-journal/ class="link black dim">The Married Journal</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I love being right in the middle of a memorable moment when a certain kind of happiness overcomes me, and I can’t help but think, “I will never forget this.” Those moments are deemed “memorable” for whatever reason, and can stay in our hearts forever.

Our time is very valuable as married couples, individuals, and parents. Weekends seem to be dispersed between your own events and obligations, family events, or just plain staying home on a Saturday night relaxing! If you got kids, throw in their games and activities, too.

The reason I asked is because this is something my husband and I have been trying to figure out for a while now! I&rsquo;ve seen many couples do workouts together, or go on the same diets. I think it&rsquo;s cool to have it be something you can do together because you get healthy while spending time together, you can encourage each other, and it can be convenient to eat the same meals.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/being-a-married-college-student/ class="link black dim">Being a Married College Student</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m grateful that I was able to experience college being both single, and then married.

THINK ABOUT YOUR SOCIAL CONNECTIONS I didn&rsquo;t think there was a problem having tons of friends when I first started facebook back in high school. It was neat to be able to connect, but then I realized how it can make me feel envious or inadequate when I spend a lot of time on it and am involved in other people&rsquo;s lives so much.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/love-notes-the-lifelong-love-letter/ class="link black dim">Love Notes: The Lifelong Love Letter</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">My husband and I have both mentioned in posts how much we enjoy giving and receiving love notes from each other. I really think there&rsquo;s an awesome power that comes with love notes. Having a physical copy of how your spouse feels about you is something you can refer to in years to come, which makes it more special. Trevor and I used to write more to each other while we were dating, and I think it&rsquo;s because we lived an hour away from each other.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-smashing-valentines-day/ class="link black dim">A Smashing Valentine's Day</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This Valentine&rsquo;s Day is going to be a little more low-key for us and we like it that way right now. :) However, low-key doesn&rsquo;t mean we aren&rsquo;t doing anything new or special!

Back in college I had to do an assignment relating marriage and relationships to something. It could be an object or an action, we just had to explain why. I found a lot of similarities between hiking and marriage so I wrote all those down here for you! :)
It&rsquo;s a crazy, fun, stressful, scary, beautiful adventure together.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-honeymoon-phase/ class="link black dim">The Honeymoon phase</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When you think about a typical honeymoon (or look back on your own honeymoon), it&rsquo;s a pretty great experience :) This picture is of us on our honeymoon to Park City; a.k.a Our best vacation ever! Honeymoons are full of fun, low-stress, and are fairly worry-free because the happiness of being together outweighs everything. That happiness continues on after the vacation is over. Hence, the &ldquo;honeymoon phase&rdquo; phrase, haha. It was such a simple time.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/do-your-best/ class="link black dim">Do Your Best</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;ve totally been absent for a long time, I know. Sorry. I definitely have my reasons though. I love blogging and writing about aspects of married life that can be useful for people, but I think it&rsquo;s important to take a step back from writing, and just enjoy those aspects of married life, instead.
I&rsquo;ve been so busy the past few months. Though I enjoy being busy for the most part, I start to hate it when it is consistent and doesn&rsquo;t come with a nice break.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/our-first-apartment/ class="link black dim">Our First Apartment</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Our little apartment is being emptied. All the pictures and artwork have been taken down from the walls, leaving them as blank as a piece of paper. Our couch has been sold, so movies are being watched in our bed now. The shelves have been cleared, and the drawers are empty. Clothes are in bags, appliances are wrapped up, and the random things are boxed up.. Well, pretty much everything is boxed up&mldr; our life&mldr; it&rsquo;s all boxed up and ready to be put elsewhere.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/if-friends-were-flowers-id-pick-you/ class="link black dim">If Friends Were Flowers, I'd Pick You</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Before I got married, I would hear things about how friendships change when a friend gets married. I heard that the girls nights disappear, and the friends stop calling each other. I heard that single friends think their married friend is too consumed in their husband to care about them, or that there&rsquo;s no relating to each other anymore. I&rsquo;ve also heard that the single friend feels like their married friend is always trying to set them, and it&rsquo;s annoying to them.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-music-to-our-marriage/ class="link black dim">The Music to Our Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Music is one of my favorite things that this life offers us. It has the power to inspire, to soften hearts, to change a mood, to make our bodies move, and ultimately, it can make us happy. My favorite thing about music, however, is its ability to preserve a memory, whether happy or sad, silly or annoying. I absolutely love that because of the many, MANY songs on my personal favorites list, every single one of them involves a memory&mldr; Singing Backstreet Boys songs with my friend every drive I took from St.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/starting-our-second-year/ class="link black dim">Starting Our Second Year</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We are now on month 13 and I&rsquo;m feeling grateful for where we are at. It is funny because this month I&rsquo;ve suddenly felt like we gained a little bit more maturity with completing one year. Every year brings it&rsquo;s certain experiences that allow us to learn and grow, so each year we&rsquo;ll become just a little tinsy-tiny bit more wiser than the year before, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to it :) With that being said, I think it is important to look back at things we have learned.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-importance-of-fun/ class="link black dim">The Importance of Fun</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We&rsquo;ve mentioned our ideals on dating in marriage before, but we&rsquo;ll mention it again: One of our expectations going into our marriage, was committing to have a date night each week. In looking back at our first year, I don&rsquo;t think we missed a week. I know it&rsquo;s so much easier for newlyweds to continue to date, and make time for dates, but that&rsquo;s not an excuse to lack! No matter what stage of marriage you are in, I hope you ask each other out on fun dates still.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/one-year/ class="link black dim">One Year</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Well, Trevor and I have now been married for one year! It&rsquo;s an interesting feeling of happiness, pride, excitement, and weirdness at the same time&mldr; if that makes any sense, haha. It is weird because of how quickly, yet slowly the year went by, and how different we are from a year ago! We were individuals that learned how to be one. We made plans, and some of those plans changed in unexpected ways.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/anniversary-gifts/ class="link black dim">Anniversary Gifts</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Our one year anniversary is coming up, and I am finding myself getting more excited about it each day! I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how things were a year ago, and how far we have come since then. I have started looking back at our first year with such gratitude for the blessings that have come, and also for the trials that we have seen. And then I stumble upon all the cute things that made me fall in love with Trevor in the first place :) And that puts me in an instant twitterpated state of mind, haha.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/sharing-is-caring/ class="link black dim">10 Things You Share in Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Lately I&rsquo;ve been seeing how great it can be to share things with your spouse!
I had the reminder of this when I had consistent problems with my laptop computer that was junky, and Trevor suggested that I take over his personal macbook which was much much better than my PC. I&rsquo;m sooooo grateful that I had someone else to rely on and offer to share with me, or else I would be without a computer and be stressed over finding the money to buy a new one!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/five-excuses/ class="link black dim">Five Excuses</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Trevor and I really enjoy having awesome TV shows to watch. We&rsquo;ve already made that known in a previous post, where we spent most of March inside, while trading off being sick. There&rsquo;s only so much you can do when you don&rsquo;t feel well, right? But then what about the days that we feel great? Is it bad to enjoy a few episodes of a TV show? I mean, we all do it!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/stars-and-butterflies/ class="link black dim">Stars and Butterflies</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;ve been thinking a lot lately about the way our blog is viewed. I wonder how our experiences are responded to. I wonder if we&rsquo;re too bold in some of our marriage ideals. And sometimes I wonder if our life comes off as this airy fantasy of what marriage really is like. After I have written something, I think back at the reasons we established this blog and ask myself if the particular post can be beneficial to our readers.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/couch-potatoes/ class="link black dim">Couch Potatoes</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The past three weeks, Trevor and I have felt like we&rsquo;ve been bums, couch potatoes, or whatever you call it. I am just finishing a cold I have had for the past 3 weeks, so I haven&rsquo;t had much energy to workout, or do extra things beyond the necessary chores. I&rsquo;ve mostly been tired, while Trevor has also been tired from some adjustments in his new job. While he loves it, his brain can be on overload sometimes.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/365-date-night-ideas/ class="link black dim">365 Date Night Ideas</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Let&rsquo;s be honest here. Every now and then, date nights can get a little routine doing the same things we usually do. This happens with us newlyweds too, believe it or not! So new ideas for date nights are good to have on those nights we feel like being spontaneous, or just wanting to do something different. Well, this is an idea that you can do any day of the week, in any season.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/365-days-of-love/ class="link black dim">365 Days of Love</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This was how our year of 2013 was well-spent.

1863 laughs.

1.7 million kisses. (give or take a few)

As I’m very thankful for many things, the biggest blessing of all has been to have the love of my dear husband, Trevor.
I have several moments where I have so much gratitude for my spouse that I want to shout to the world, “I have the cutest husband!” However, I’m realizing that a better, more respectful thing to say, would be something along the lines of, “My husband is perfect for me” or “I’m so thankful for my husband.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/marriage-guidelines/ class="link black dim">Marriage Guidelines</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We love it when we come across marriage being talked about in the news.

Though I’m not sure that I agree with titling these “marriage commandments,” I do think it’s a great suggestion to compare them to the ten commandments we have been taught about through the gospel.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/i-love-love-notes/ class="link black dim">I Love Love Notes</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Amy and I can be a little goofy at times&mldr; Actually, pretty much all the time :)
One of the goofy things we do is call each other &ldquo;mine.&rdquo; I came home to a note on the table today that said &ldquo;mine.&rdquo;
I love my wife. I am very thankful for the nice little notes that she leaves me around our apartment, on our bathroom mirror, on the fridge, through text messages, and through voicemails.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/top-10-cheap-date-ideas/ class="link black dim">Top 10 Cheap Date Ideas</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Life is busy. There seems to be a never-ending list of stuff to fill our time with: work, school, errands, meal preparation, eating, sleeping, cleaning, exercise, church responsibilities, hobbies, appointments, social activities&mldr; You get the point :)
Life can easily suffocate our schedules with endless commitments without leaving time for the ones we love most. To avoid this, my wife and I have set a goal to have an official date night at least once a week.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-three-week-milestone/ class="link black dim">The Three Week Milestone</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">In the first three weeks of being married, I learned: The difference between wants and needs.

It was lovely just sitting on the lush, green, grass, just eating, talking, and laughing.
