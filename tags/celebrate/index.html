I&rsquo;m a huge crafter and designed these gift tags for holiday gifts to some of our neighbors! I own a Cricut machine and have basically had it out all season long doing holiday stuff!

What’s a “White Elephant” gift? It’s a silly gag gift usually for playing a White Elephant game!
How does it work? There&rsquo;s a pile of gifts, one per person who is playing. Everyone draws a number which decides the order they choose a gift from the pile. If you have 13 people/13 gifts, you’ll have numbers 1-13 to draw from. Starting with person #1, they will choose a gift from the pile to unwrap and reveal to everyone.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/50-gift-ideas-for-your-spouse/ class="link black dim">50 Gift Ideas for Your Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Every birthday, Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and wedding anniversary, I find myself googling thoughtful gift ideas that I can buy or make for my spouse.

Over the past few years, I have been keeping track of some awesome finds that interest me or my spouse, and I think most spouses would love too.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/3-tips-for-preventing-holiday-stress-from-affecting-your-marriage/ class="link black dim">3 Tips For Preventing Holiday Stress From Affecting Your Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We are all well aware that while the holiday season can be a wonderful time of year spent with loved ones, it can also bring with it some stress. Just a few examples: spending hours trying to make your house look festive; thinking of the perfect gifts for family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers, then having to go get those gifts and wrap them, while trying to not spend a fortune; making special food for the celebrations; and feeling pressure to make special memories.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/back-to-school-interview-for-your-spouse/ class="link black dim">Back to School Interview For Your Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Back to School InterviewThis is inspired by an email newsletter I received titled, &ldquo;Interviews aren&rsquo;t just for adults,&rdquo; where I saw a cute picture of a kid holding up one of those back to school/all about me interview papers that people tend to do with their kids every year.

I don&rsquo;t know a marriage that doesn&rsquo;t give cards or love notes to each other for special occasions or even just for no reason at all! They can seem boring sometimes unless you get a funny one, or one that just has that unique factor&mldr;
WELL. I&rsquo;m going to show you how to make the EASIEST unique card you&rsquo;ve ever seen! It folds and opens in a fun way, you can make at home with supplies you most likely have laying around, and you can embellish it however you want!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/be-joyful/ class="link black dim">Be Joyful</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Since this is our 3rd attempt at Christmas cards, I kinda feel like I got it right.

This morning I went through my old journal from that time we were first dating and it was so special to go back and read all of that.

I love this phrase because though being a spouse has its difficult moments, it&rsquo;s still such a rewarding life! This phrase is all about looking at the positive in marriage! There have been a few rough things we&rsquo;ve had to experience in our marriage, but even in those times I find myself taking on this mindset, that the good outweighs the bad, and that I wouldn&rsquo;t rather be with anyone else :)</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-real-love-your-spouse-challenge/ class="link black dim">The Real 'Love Your Spouse' Challenge</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;282060156&rdquo; ]
So I got nominated to do that &lsquo;Love Your Spouse&rsquo; Challenge, but I&rsquo;m not going to do it. It might be surprising since I&rsquo;m a huge advocate of marriage, and that I totally admire this challenge going around! It&rsquo;s important to publically share your feelings about your spouse, acknowledge their talents and how they have influenced your marriage, etc. But I think there can be TOO much of that sometimes.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/6-ways-to-prioritize-your-spouse/ class="link black dim">6 Ways to Prioritize Your Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A reader asked what I would suggest as ways to prioritize your spouse, and I decided to put all that information in a post because my reply is too big for a comment box! haha.

The idea of growing apart happens gradually over time. When you think about it, there will always be sudden situations that come up where you do need to be there for your kids over your spouse, but I think the problem starts when this is happening frequently.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/10-ways-to-journal-your-life-together/ class="link black dim">10 Ways to Journal Your Life Together</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*this post contains affiliate links.
I recently looked through the scrapbook I made of our first year together, and it was fun taking this trip down memory lane, again!

Well, pretty much everything is boxed up&mldr; our life&mldr; it&rsquo;s all boxed up and ready to be put elsewhere.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/our-house-story-part-2-you-can-learn-a-lot-in-four-days/ class="link black dim">Our House Story Part 2: You Can Learn a Lot in Four Days</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">If you read Part 1, you&rsquo;ll know that we went into our appointment feeling worried about the huge price increase on the home plan we were interested in the most. We let them know we were very serious about this home, but that the price jump was going to be a deal-breaker for us. We asked the rep if there was anything they can do for us on that, since it happened literally overnight.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/our-house-story-part-1-timing-is-everything/ class="link black dim">Our House Story Part 1: Timing is Everything</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When we first started thinking about the idea of moving and buying a house, it was difficult to be fully invested in the idea because there were multiple factors that were up in the air that could alter that idea. It really felt like everything was about timing. We weren&rsquo;t sure if the timing was right with me going back to school. We also weren&rsquo;t sure if we should save up a little more, though we did already have a down payment.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/home-is-insert-cliche-here/ class="link black dim">Home is {insert cliche here}</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Ready for these two exciting announcements?
We are moving! We bought a house! Yep. This just got real. It&rsquo;s awesome yet crazy, and just a huge step in our lives but we are so excited to take that step! Though the idea of moving has been in the works for us for about five months, the opportunity with this specific house came up quick. And when I mean quick, I mean that we had three days to decide on it, haha.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-thing-about-provo/ class="link black dim">The Thing About Provo</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We love living in Provo. There&rsquo;s some great things about this area (Provo & Orem) that set it apart from other cities in Utah. The music scene has been great to be a part of, and has been the creator of some memorable date nights for us. Someone, somewhere nearby, for some inexpensive price is always playing, and they are usually pretty entertaining. I don&rsquo;t know of any town that can do that, let alone, has enough talent to give birth to some great bands.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/starting-our-second-year/ class="link black dim">Starting Our Second Year</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We are now on month 13 and I&rsquo;m feeling grateful for where we are at. It is funny because this month I&rsquo;ve suddenly felt like we gained a little bit more maturity with completing one year. Every year brings it&rsquo;s certain experiences that allow us to learn and grow, so each year we&rsquo;ll become just a little tinsy-tiny bit more wiser than the year before, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to it :) With that being said, I think it is important to look back at things we have learned.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/one-year/ class="link black dim">One Year</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Well, Trevor and I have now been married for one year! It&rsquo;s an interesting feeling of happiness, pride, excitement, and weirdness at the same time&mldr; if that makes any sense, haha. It is weird because of how quickly, yet slowly the year went by, and how different we are from a year ago! We were individuals that learned how to be one. We made plans, and some of those plans changed in unexpected ways.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/anniversary-gifts/ class="link black dim">Anniversary Gifts</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Our one year anniversary is coming up, and I am finding myself getting more excited about it each day! I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how things were a year ago, and how far we have come since then. I have started looking back at our first year with such gratitude for the blessings that have come, and also for the trials that we have seen. And then I stumble upon all the cute things that made me fall in love with Trevor in the first place :) And that puts me in an instant twitterpated state of mind, haha.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/golden-bunnies/ class="link black dim">The Easter Bunny</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I remember reading an article last month on Huffington Post called, &ldquo;Can We Bring The Holidays Down A Notch?&rdquo; It&rsquo;s a Mom telling about the stress that she feels comes with Holidays while feeling pressure from other moms who seem to make each holiday bigger than the last. I&rsquo;m not a mom with kids who sometimes need to be pampered with gifts on holidays, but as a newlywed, I can relate to feeling that pressure as well.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/not-too-cool-for-school/ class="link black dim">Not Too Cool for School</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">School. There&rsquo;s so much importance that is stressed on getting an education, and going to school. It&rsquo;s something that seems to be on every young-adult&rsquo;s mind, because getting a degree is the next step after high school. It&rsquo;s what everyone is doing, right? Well, not everyone.
It can be harder to accomplish this personal goal when married. The typical cycle around here, is that some couples find it best to have one spouse put school on hold to help support the other spouse&rsquo;s education, with the hope that when they finish, the other spouse can go back and finish.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/national-old-stuff-day/ class="link black dim">National Old Stuff Day</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">My twenty-second year was the best year of my life.
Yesterday, I told Trevor my feelings on this past birthday year, and how I think it&rsquo;s going to be hard to top. He said, &ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t say that! We are together, so every year is going to get better and better.&rdquo; I loved it. I think trials are bound to happen in the years ahead of us, because there is so much more that we get to, and need to experience.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/happy-opportunities/ class="link black dim">Happy Opportunities</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This new year has already been eventful for us.

Exciting news to share Trevor has chosen to start his career earlier than we planned, with a job offer from his dream job!

You probably noticed that we have been gone for a while. Yes, we were with family. Yes, we were partying it up with Christmas and the New Year and what not&mldr;but we were also working on this amazingly awesome new website! Wooo hooo! We hope you like it.
Along with the website updates, we created a new email list and social media accounts. Basically, to sum everything up, we are trying to make Freshly Married a better resource to help strengthen marriages.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/traditions/ class="link black dim">A Traditional Christmas</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">It’s been said that this is the most wonderful time of the year. And other than this freezing cold weather we have been having, it sure feels true to me!
This seems to be the best Christmas season I’ve ever had. The first reason is because I get to experience it married to the love of my life, who automatically makes things the best. :) The second reason is because I feel a special kind of excitement for the many “firsts” and new traditions that we get to have.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/lets-commemorate-something/ class="link black dim">Six Month Anniversary - Let's Commemorate Something</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Trevor laughs at all the little moments in our relationship I try to commemorate, or that I feel the need to commemorate. When he sees a bottle of sparkling cider in the cupboard, I think he traces his memories to find out what moment I&rsquo;m wanting to make a toast about with it (haha). Well, today is our six month anniversary, so naturally, I pulled out a bottle to celebrate over dinner.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/lds-weddings-101-our-wedding-day/ class="link black dim">LDS Weddings 101: Our Wedding Day</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The sealing The best and most important part was done first thing in the morning: Get married to my best friend! After that, the mishaps don’t matter, because you are happy as can be!
Photography Pictures were taken with family and friends on the temple grounds, and afterwards, Trevor and I spent about an hour taking pictures just us and the photographer.

From the Groom to the ceremony; to the decorations to the guests; and from the food to the fun, I loved it all! Of course, the day had a few blips, but that is inevitable! What it all came down to, was that I had just married the most perfect man for me, and we were celebrating that fact with people who loved and supported us.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-three-week-milestone/ class="link black dim">The Three Week Milestone</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">In the first three weeks of being married, I learned: The difference between wants and needs.
