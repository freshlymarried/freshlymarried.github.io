How often or frequent should we be having sex? Does more sex make for a happier marriage? I’m going to give some insight that can help answer these two questions if you have been asking them yourself!
THE FACTS + FINDINGS There are several studies that have been done out there to determine what the &ldquo;magic number&rdquo; is for answering this question.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/same-old-dates/ class="link black dim">Same Old Dates</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">THE SPECIAL OCCASION PRESSURES The night before Valentine&rsquo;s Day, we were talking about our holiday plans and my husband voiced to me that he has spent hours over the past few weeks trying to figure out a special activity for us to do for Valentine&rsquo;s Day that wasn&rsquo;t something we had already done or that feels &ldquo;same ole, same ole&rdquo; like going to the movies.

I think one of the biggest hangups a couple can have when it comes to their sex life is not understanding their own sexuality first. It makes me sad that so many married people don’t even understand this huge part of their life and who they are. Which is like, the basis of a satisfying sex life for both husband and wife!
Why it&rsquo;s important SOOOO I want to talk just a little bit about this.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-the-six-second-kiss/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: The Six-Second Kiss</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">#freshfridays quote asking &ldquo;Have you had your six-second kiss today?&rdquo;
I don&rsquo;t think we should look at the word &lsquo;potential&rsquo; with an eye-roll, because it doesn&rsquo;t mean a long kiss has to lead to sex. An extra long kiss is just more special than the quick kiss goodbye or quick kiss when getting home from work.
So I think the &lsquo;potential&rsquo; he&rsquo;s referring to is focused more on how that kind of intentional and more meaningful kiss can lead to a more meaningful relationship; more meaningful days together; more meaningful emotional intimacy.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/selflessness-the-key-to-great-emotional-physical-intimacy/ class="link black dim">Selflessness: The Key to Great Emotional & Physical Intimacy</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links.
I truly believe in selflessness. I’ve spoken about this before on different videos and blog post topics because pride or selflessness influences every single aspect of marriage!
I believe that when both spouses are being selfless, it can begin this beautiful cycle of deeper connection and more physical satisfaction. What was that last feeling? Physical satisfaction? YEP. Let’s talk about it!
To apply this “cycle” to sexual intimacy, if you are putting your spouse first, wanting them to have a satisfying experience, they will want to give you a satisfying experience right back.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/ajoyfulmarriage-week-7/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 7</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The joy I found in my marriage this week: thoughtful surprises!

I don&rsquo;t know a marriage that doesn&rsquo;t give cards or love notes to each other for special occasions or even just for no reason at all! They can seem boring sometimes unless you get a funny one, or one that just has that unique factor&mldr;

Over the past four years together, we have managed to find some two-player games to play at home, but we get bored of them real quick. Since every couple needs to have some games to turn to, especially in the winter time, I figured I would make one big list for us all!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-perfectly-imperfect-reminder/ class="link black dim">A Perfectly Imperfect Reminder</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Today is a special day :) Four years ago on October 25th, Trevor and I made our relationship official. See, it was declared on facebook so it was official &mldr; haha
This morning I went through my old journal from that time we were first dating and it was so special to go back and read all of that. I obviously knew our timeline and the words we said but there was something so tender about reading about it all, and especially my feelings during the rise of our relationship.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-real-love-your-spouse-challenge/ class="link black dim">The Real 'Love Your Spouse' Challenge</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;282060156&rdquo; ]
So I got nominated to do that &lsquo;Love Your Spouse&rsquo; Challenge, but I&rsquo;m not going to do it. It might be surprising since I&rsquo;m a huge advocate of marriage, and that I totally admire this challenge going around! It&rsquo;s important to publically share your feelings about your spouse, acknowledge their talents and how they have influenced your marriage, etc. But I think there can be TOO much of that sometimes.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/date-night-pressures/ class="link black dim">Date Night Pressures</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Everyone knows that I&rsquo;m a big promoter of date night.

I just believe that it&rsquo;s important to have time together alone with your spouse. :) But I don&rsquo;t want to give anyone the idea that your time together has to be epic enough to be given the &ldquo;date night&rdquo; title. Date night shouldn&rsquo;t feel pressured.
All quality time is important!

This week my focus is on the importance of recording the memories in marriage! I talk about how important it is to journal the little details here, with 10 ideas for how you can do that!

The obvious ways we do this are through movies and novels, right? Writers make up these passionate love stories that (most of the time) are unlikely to happen, with the most convenient circumstances. When these stories are played out in movies, of course, we finally get to see it all played out visually so everything is played up.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-sexy-dice-game/ class="link black dim">The Sexy Dice Game</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m excited to share this idea with you guys because I think it&rsquo;s a fun, EASY way to switch things up when it comes to your sex life!
For whatever reason, we all experience a hiatus of sexual intimacy at times.

GO ON A DATE! I know I say this a lot, and I don&rsquo;t want to come off as annoying, judge-y or insensitive when I write this post.

But we enjoyed these little moments. Any excuse to kiss right?!
Over the past three years, I&rsquo;m sorry to say we haven&rsquo;t kept up with that tradition!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/love-notes-the-lifelong-love-letter/ class="link black dim">Love Notes: The Lifelong Love Letter</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">My husband and I have both mentioned in posts how much we enjoy giving and receiving love notes from each other.

Good feelings or bad feelings can be the difference between staying up all night or having a beautiful sleep!
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong here, I&rsquo;m not saying that if you don&rsquo;t kiss your spouse goodnight that you are a terrible spouse, or that you&rsquo;ll have bad feelings before you fall asleep!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/love-languages-part-2-speaking/ class="link black dim">Love Languages Part 2: Speaking</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*You will get the most out of this post if you read Love Languages Part 1: Understanding*

On our first date, Trevor and I started talking about some things we like to do, and we found most of them we had in common (of course!)

It started as that, and then somehow it turned into things that we were possibly going to do together&mldr; :) So being the list people that we are, Trevor pulled out his phone and created a google doc, listing these things to do.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/putting-your-spouse-before-children/ class="link black dim">Prioritizing My Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I used to be one of those people that thought you should do anything and everything for your kids - that they should be the priority. It&rsquo;s portrayed in movies of parents willing to do anything for their kids.

There have been some interesting findings that have come from a blog post I wrote a few months ago, and I would like to share those with you.
A few months back, I wrote my long-held opinion on bikinis, in the post: &ldquo;Save it For Your Husband.&rdquo; I suggest reading it if you haven&rsquo;t yet, as it can shed some more light on this current post.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-sudden-date-night/ class="link black dim">A Sudden Date Night</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I like doing surprise/spur-of-the-moment dates. Especially when they are much needed.
I have had some medical concerns (or you could call them annoyances!) for several months now. (I&rsquo;m not pregnant, don&rsquo;t worry, haha.) I&rsquo;ll have slumps of days when almost any food sounds good to eat, but then I&rsquo;ll have annoying streaks when I don&rsquo;t want to eat anything; sometimes it gets to the point of just thinking of my favorite foods makes me want to gag.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-music-to-our-marriage/ class="link black dim">The Music to Our Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Music is one of my favorite things that this life offers us. It has the power to inspire, to soften hearts, to change a mood, to make our bodies move, and ultimately, it can make us happy. My favorite thing about music, however, is its ability to preserve a memory, whether happy or sad, silly or annoying. I absolutely love that because of the many, MANY songs on my personal favorites list, every single one of them involves a memory&mldr; Singing Backstreet Boys songs with my friend every drive I took from St.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/starting-our-second-year/ class="link black dim">Starting Our Second Year</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We are now on month 13 and I&rsquo;m feeling grateful for where we are at. It is funny because this month I&rsquo;ve suddenly felt like we gained a little bit more maturity with completing one year. Every year brings it&rsquo;s certain experiences that allow us to learn and grow, so each year we&rsquo;ll become just a little tinsy-tiny bit more wiser than the year before, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to it :) With that being said, I think it is important to look back at things we have learned.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-importance-of-fun/ class="link black dim">The Importance of Fun</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We&rsquo;ve mentioned our ideals on dating in marriage before, but we&rsquo;ll mention it again: One of our expectations going into our marriage, was committing to have a date night each week. In looking back at our first year, I don&rsquo;t think we missed a week. I know it&rsquo;s so much easier for newlyweds to continue to date, and make time for dates, but that&rsquo;s not an excuse to lack! No matter what stage of marriage you are in, I hope you ask each other out on fun dates still.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/save-it-for-your-husband/ class="link black dim">Save It For Your Husband</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Feel free to LISTEN to this blog post below!

I don&rsquo;t like bikinis, I don&rsquo;t wear them. I think they are immodest and inappropriate and impractical to be wearing swimming. I have read a few articles the past month, that have lead me to feel strongly about sharing why I feel this way about bikinis. One of those articles was, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not celebrating bikini season this year&rdquo; by Kit Steinkellner.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/one-year/ class="link black dim">One Year</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Well, Trevor and I have now been married for one year! It&rsquo;s an interesting feeling of happiness, pride, excitement, and weirdness at the same time&mldr; if that makes any sense, haha. It is weird because of how quickly, yet slowly the year went by, and how different we are from a year ago! We were individuals that learned how to be one. We made plans, and some of those plans changed in unexpected ways.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/i-know-how-the-river-feels/ class="link black dim">I Know How The River Feels</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I found this quote a long time ago, and it has been my favorite ever since. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t like the song that these words come from, haha. I will credit the band and the song though anyways. The lyrics come from the song, &ldquo;I Know How The River Feels,&rdquo; by Diamond Rio.
As a young adult, there were so many directions to go, and many crucial life decisions coming at me.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/anniversary-gifts/ class="link black dim">Anniversary Gifts</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Our one year anniversary is coming up, and I am finding myself getting more excited about it each day! I&rsquo;ve been thinking about how things were a year ago, and how far we have come since then. I have started looking back at our first year with such gratitude for the blessings that have come, and also for the trials that we have seen. And then I stumble upon all the cute things that made me fall in love with Trevor in the first place :) And that puts me in an instant twitterpated state of mind, haha.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/scissors-and-glue/ class="link black dim">Scissors and Glue</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">For more than 11 years I have kept a quote book, where I have written down any intuitive thoughts, quotes, lyrics, speeches, movie lines, or any other words that I have found meaningful.

I know, I act like a twelve-year-old sometimes because I say &ldquo;your face is a _____ &ldquo;(fill in the blank), whenever the opportunity arises, haha.

So new ideas for date nights are good to have on those nights we feel like being spontaneous, or just wanting to do something different.

On Saturday morning, I woke up and rolled over in bed to face Trevor. I found him still asleep, which typically happens, but this time I couldn&rsquo;t help but stare at him.
