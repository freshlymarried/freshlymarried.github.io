It&rsquo;s because relationship education is important! And yet so many people have either never heard of it before, are intimidated by it, scared of it, or assume it means you have relationship problems you need help with. WELL NEWSFLASH, WE ALL HAVE PROBLEMS! haha. But really.
Because I believe passionately that relationship education is a helpful tool for all relationships, not just marriage, I want to explain what relationship education is while addressing some misunderstandings so that you can feel more comfortable with seeking help.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/back-to-school-interview-for-your-spouse/ class="link black dim">Back to School Interview For Your Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Back to School InterviewThis is inspired by an email newsletter I received titled, &ldquo;Interviews aren&rsquo;t just for adults,&rdquo; where I saw a cute picture of a kid holding up one of those back to school/all about me interview papers that people tend to do with their kids every year.

We are on a Caribbean cruise ringing in the new year, so it&rsquo;s a little belated from me! That&rsquo;s also the reason why we just barely did our annual dinner date night where we share and discuss our goals for the year together. We typically do it on New Year&rsquo;s Eve but we felt like saving it until we got home from our trip. Especially because this fun stuff was going on!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/marriage-is-hard-work/ class="link black dim">Marriage is "Hard Work"</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">If you want ^^this^^ you gotta be willing to work for it [sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;282494134&rdquo; ]
When people say that marriage is &ldquo;hard work&rdquo; (which it is!), it&rsquo;s important to explain what kind of work that means so newlyweds don&rsquo;t think exhaustion and stress is all they are getting into!
I think it&rsquo;s hard work because it&rsquo;s a commitment that you&rsquo;ve never encountered before.
Our friends mean so much to all of us.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/object-lessons-puzzles/ class="link black dim">Object Lessons: Puzzles</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Have you ever tried to complete a puzzle without looking at the picture on the box?

Being able to look at the box was a great guide and comfort though the process.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/#freshfridays-quote-look-for-the-virtues/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: Look For The Virtues</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">“…There would be far less of divorce, much less of infidelity, much less of anger and rancor and quarreling.

Looking for the good in your spouse daily — YES that’s DEFINITELY a smart technique to use in marriage!
Look for the good, look for the positive, and look for the reasons why you fell in love with them in the first place.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/6-ways-to-prioritize-your-spouse/ class="link black dim">6 Ways to Prioritize Your Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A reader asked what I would suggest as ways to prioritize your spouse, and I decided to put all that information in a post because my reply is too big for a comment box! haha. So here&rsquo;s my reply to my previous post: &ldquo;Prioritizing My Spouse.&rdquo;
The idea of growing apart happens gradually over time. When you think about it, there will always be sudden situations that come up where you do need to be there for your kids over your spouse, but I think the problem starts when this is happening frequently.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-marriage-is-a-family-too/ class="link black dim">A Marriage is a Family, Too</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Sometimes I get the feeling that people take marriage for granted or discount its importance. I&rsquo;m not just saying that because I&rsquo;m a marriage guru, or because I don&rsquo;t understand what it&rsquo;s like to have children of my own yet! From conversations I have had with people lately, they have made comments that appear to me as devaluing a family that only consists of husband and wife. It&rsquo;s as if they think a married couple simply on their own isn&rsquo;t good enough, or isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;family&rdquo; compared to a married couple with children.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/invest-more-in-your-marriage-than-in-your-kids/ class="link black dim">Invest More in Your Marriage Than in Your Kids</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A HAPPY AND HEALTHY FAMILY BEGINS WITH MARRIAGE In the previous post connected to this, I discussed how it&rsquo;s becoming more normal to put less importance on marriage and more importance on kids. I think that this normalized mindset has given people this idea that a family only consisting of a husband and wife isn&rsquo;t good enough compared to a family that has a husband, wife, and kids.

The reason I asked is because this is something my husband and I have been trying to figure out for a while now! I&rsquo;ve seen many couples do workouts together, or go on the same diets. I think it&rsquo;s cool to have it be something you can do together because you get healthy while spending time together, you can encourage each other, and it can be convenient to eat the same meals.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/being-a-married-college-student/ class="link black dim">Being a Married College Student</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m grateful that I was able to experience college being both single, and then married.

When we look at our spouses, we should view them with a sense of compassion, recognizing that they have weaknesses just like you do. And then I hope that compassion turns into excitement thinking about how great your marriage can be; how it can improve and strengthen.
Your spouse has potential, your marriage has potential.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-smashing-valentines-day/ class="link black dim">A Smashing Valentine's Day</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This Valentine&rsquo;s Day is going to be a little more low-key for us and we like it that way right now. :) However, low-key doesn&rsquo;t mean we aren&rsquo;t doing anything new or special!

So many people right now are thinking about how they can better themselves for the new year. I am doing that right now, too!

A few that I have received better insight into this year are marriages that have a spouse serving in the armed forces, police work, firefighters, or EMT&rsquo;s. Because of their job description and the sacrifice they make to help protect us, they face different challenges in their marriages than other couples might face. Since I do not have first-hand experience in this area, I asked someone who has absolute experience in this to help us understand better.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-difference-between-an-ordinary-marriage-and-an-extraordinary-marriage/ class="link black dim">The Difference Between an Ordinary Marriage and an Extraordinary Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When I watch TV shows that portray a husband and wife relationship, I get annoyed sometimes with how they act towards each other. Examples of this: Wives nagging their husbands and saying they don&rsquo;t do anything for them ever.

On our first date, Trevor and I started talking about some things we like to do, and we found most of them we had in common (of course!) Since he had recently come home from serving an Latter-Day Saint mission, I started suggesting some of the movies he should watch and music to listen to that came out while he was gone. It started as that, and then somehow it turned into things that we were possibly going to do together&mldr; :) So being the list people that we are, Trevor pulled out his phone and created a google doc, listing these things to do.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/prioritizing-my-spouse/ class="link black dim">Prioritizing My Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I used to be one of those people that thought you should do anything and everything for your kids - that they should be the priority. It&rsquo;s portrayed in movies of parents willing to do anything for their kids. Overtime this philosophy has changed for me, especially since finding Trevor.

There have been some interesting findings that have come from a blog post I wrote a few months ago, and I would like to share those with you.
A few months back, I wrote my long-held opinion on bikinis, in the post: &ldquo;Save it For Your Husband.&rdquo; I suggest reading it if you haven&rsquo;t yet, as it can shed some more light on this current post.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/our-first-apartment/ class="link black dim">Our First Apartment</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Our little apartment is being emptied. All the pictures and artwork have been taken down from the walls, leaving them as blank as a piece of paper. Our couch has been sold, so movies are being watched in our bed now. The shelves have been cleared, and the drawers are empty. Clothes are in bags, appliances are wrapped up, and the random things are boxed up.. Well, pretty much everything is boxed up&mldr; our life&mldr; it&rsquo;s all boxed up and ready to be put elsewhere.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/what-food-storage-is-for/ class="link black dim">What Food Storage is For</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Buying a house can be expensive&mldr; Haha, that&rsquo;s an obvious thing. The price gets higher and higher with every new appliance or furniture purchase, too. After buying the necessary refrigerator, washer and dryer, and a couch, you could say our savings is getting depleted! Even though we have the money for it, and are being responsible, it&rsquo;s put us on a tight budget this month and next month, as we make sure we have enough money for all the living essentials and closing costs coming up.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/defending-motherhood/ class="link black dim">Defending Motherhood</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Pregnancy. It either happens when you want it, don&rsquo;t want it, were not expecting it, or couldn&rsquo;t wait soon enough for. It&rsquo;s usually pretty great news to hear, right? Whether the news is for yourself or for someone else, it is really exciting to see one of God&rsquo;s greatest miracles happening to someone you know, and someone you care about. One of my friends and past roommates recently found out she is pregnant :) I&rsquo;m so happy for her to be a mom because I know without a doubt, that is her mission in life.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/our-house-story-part-2-you-can-learn-a-lot-in-four-days/ class="link black dim">Our House Story Part 2: You Can Learn a Lot in Four Days</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">If you read Part 1, you&rsquo;ll know that we went into our appointment feeling worried about the huge price increase on the home plan we were interested in the most. We let them know we were very serious about this home, but that the price jump was going to be a deal-breaker for us. We asked the rep if there was anything they can do for us on that, since it happened literally overnight.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/our-house-story-part-1-timing-is-everything/ class="link black dim">Our House Story Part 1: Timing is Everything</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When we first started thinking about the idea of moving and buying a house, it was difficult to be fully invested in the idea because there were multiple factors that were up in the air that could alter that idea. It really felt like everything was about timing. We weren&rsquo;t sure if the timing was right with me going back to school. We also weren&rsquo;t sure if we should save up a little more, though we did already have a down payment.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/home-is-insert-cliche-here/ class="link black dim">Home is {insert cliche here}</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Ready for these two exciting announcements?
We are moving! We bought a house! Yep. This just got real. It&rsquo;s awesome yet crazy, and just a huge step in our lives but we are so excited to take that step! Though the idea of moving has been in the works for us for about five months, the opportunity with this specific house came up quick. And when I mean quick, I mean that we had three days to decide on it, haha.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/starting-our-second-year/ class="link black dim">Starting Our Second Year</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We are now on month 13 and I&rsquo;m feeling grateful for where we are at. It is funny because this month I&rsquo;ve suddenly felt like we gained a little bit more maturity with completing one year. Every year brings it&rsquo;s certain experiences that allow us to learn and grow, so each year we&rsquo;ll become just a little tinsy-tiny bit more wiser than the year before, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to it :) With that being said, I think it is important to look back at things we have learned.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/save-it-for-your-husband/ class="link black dim">Save It For Your Husband</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Feel free to LISTEN to this blog post below!

I don&rsquo;t like bikinis, I don&rsquo;t wear them. I think they are immodest and inappropriate and impractical to be wearing swimming. I have read a few articles the past month, that have lead me to feel strongly about sharing why I feel this way about bikinis. One of those articles was, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not celebrating bikini season this year&rdquo; by Kit Steinkellner.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-pressure-to-have-babies/ class="link black dim">The Pressure to Have Babies</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Remember when you first got married, and there&rsquo;s that one (or more for some of us) person who makes the comment, &ldquo;So when are you going to start having babies?&rdquo; I&rsquo;m sure we can all think of someone who said that to us, right? Some of them are just funny little grandmas just waiting to have more cheeks to pinch! But others can ask in an interrogative way about it, as if they may be upset if you give an answer that doesn&rsquo;t include the thought of immediately having a child.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/one-year/ class="link black dim">One Year</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Well, Trevor and I have now been married for one year! It&rsquo;s an interesting feeling of happiness, pride, excitement, and weirdness at the same time&mldr; if that makes any sense, haha. It is weird because of how quickly, yet slowly the year went by, and how different we are from a year ago! We were individuals that learned how to be one. We made plans, and some of those plans changed in unexpected ways.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/on-the-defense./ class="link black dim">On The Defense.</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">On Thursday, I was shamefully watching the daytime talk show, &ldquo;The View&rdquo; (I know, I stooped that low, don&rsquo;t judge me), and I was saddened by some of the comments that were being said about marriage to their guest co-host, Candace Cameron Bure (she played DJ from &ldquo;Full House&rdquo;). She came out with a recent book, so they discussed some of her ideals on marriage that were written in that book.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/not-too-cool-for-school/ class="link black dim">Not Too Cool for School</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">School. There&rsquo;s so much importance that is stressed on getting an education, and going to school. It&rsquo;s something that seems to be on every young-adult&rsquo;s mind, because getting a degree is the next step after high school. It&rsquo;s what everyone is doing, right? Well, not everyone.
It can be harder to accomplish this personal goal when married. The typical cycle around here, is that some couples find it best to have one spouse put school on hold to help support the other spouse&rsquo;s education, with the hope that when they finish, the other spouse can go back and finish.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-working-family/ class="link black dim">The Working Family</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I currently work at a desk job, answering emails and phone calls from customers. Sometimes I work with awesome, fun, and happy customers, and other times I get to work with &mldr; other customers. Let&rsquo;s face it, most people do not take the time to contact a company unless they are unsatisfied with a product. So I&rsquo;m the front man that gets to handle all of that. For the most part I love it, but some days I feel the weight of the negativity that comes from being surrounded by complaints on a daily basis.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/happy-opportunities/ class="link black dim">Happy Opportunities</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This new year has already been eventful for us.

They are GOOD changes! We&rsquo;ve been married now for about 8 months, and it&rsquo;s been a fun ride. While the transition from the single life to the married life was so awesome, it was a bigger transition for me with how independent of a person I am. One of the biggest changes I&rsquo;ve been proud of, is how much I have cut out of my life to make more time for Trevor, and to be a better wife and friend for him&mldr; I&rsquo;ve focused more on the things that matter most.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/married-at-22-and-proud-of-it/ class="link black dim">Married at 22, And Proud of It</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m sure many of you have read that article circulating, called &ldquo;23 Things to Do Instead of Getting Engaged Before You&rsquo;re 23.&rdquo; If you haven&rsquo;t read it, you might find it interesting.
