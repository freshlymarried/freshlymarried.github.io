It&amp;rsquo;s because relationship education is important! And yet so many people have either never heard of it before, are intimidated by it, scared of it, or assume it means you have relationship problems you need help with. WELL NEWSFLASH, WE ALL HAVE PROBLEMS! haha. But really.
Because I believe passionately that relationship education is a helpful tool for all relationships, not just marriage, I want to explain what relationship education is while addressing some misunderstandings so that you can feel more comfortable with seeking help.</description></item><item><title>Back to School Interview For Your Spouse</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/back-to-school-interview-for-your-spouse/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Aug 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/back-to-school-interview-for-your-spouse/</guid><description>Back to School InterviewThis is inspired by an email newsletter I received titled, &amp;ldquo;Interviews aren&amp;rsquo;t just for adults,&amp;rdquo; where I saw a cute picture of a kid holding up one of those back to school/all about me interview papers that people tend to do with their kids every year.

We are on a Caribbean cruise ringing in the new year, so it&amp;rsquo;s a little belated from me! That&amp;rsquo;s also the reason why we just barely did our annual dinner date night where we share and discuss our goals for the year together.

When people say that marriage is &amp;ldquo;hard work&amp;rdquo; (which it is!), it&amp;rsquo;s important to explain what kind of work that means so newlyweds don&amp;rsquo;t think exhaustion and stress is all they are getting into!
I think it&amp;rsquo;s hard work because it&amp;rsquo;s a commitment that you&amp;rsquo;ve never encountered before.
Our friends mean so much to all of us.</description></item><item><title>Object Lessons: Puzzles</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/object-lessons-puzzles/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/object-lessons-puzzles/</guid><description>Have you ever tried to complete a puzzle without looking at the picture on the box? A few years ago I completed a beautiful 1000 piece Thomas Kinkade Lighthouse puzzle. I probably looked at the picture on the box more than a thousand times as I tried to figure out where each piece should fit. Being able to look at the box was a great guide and comfort though the process.</description></item><item><title>#freshfridays Quote: Look For The Virtues</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/freshfridays-quote-look-for-the-virtues/</link><pubDate>Fri, 08 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/freshfridays-quote-look-for-the-virtues/</guid><description>“…There would be far less of divorce, much less of infidelity, much less of anger and rancor and quarreling. There would be more of forgiveness, more of love, more of peace, more of happiness.”
Looking for the good in your spouse daily — YES that’s DEFINITELY a smart technique to use in marriage!
Look for the good, look for the positive, and look for the reasons why you fell in love with them in the first place.</description></item><item><title>6 Ways to Prioritize Your Spouse</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/6-ways-to-prioritize-your-spouse/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/6-ways-to-prioritize-your-spouse/</guid><description>A reader asked what I would suggest as ways to prioritize your spouse, and I decided to put all that information in a post because my reply is too big for a comment box! haha. So here&amp;rsquo;s my reply to my previous post: &amp;ldquo;Prioritizing My Spouse.&amp;rdquo;
The idea of growing apart happens gradually over time. When you think about it, there will always be sudden situations that come up where you do need to be there for your kids over your spouse, but I think the problem starts when this is happening frequently.</description></item><item><title>A Marriage is a Family, Too</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/a-marriage-is-a-family-too/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/a-marriage-is-a-family-too/</guid><description>Sometimes I get the feeling that people take marriage for granted or discount its importance. I&amp;rsquo;m not just saying that because I&amp;rsquo;m a marriage guru, or because I don&amp;rsquo;t understand what it&amp;rsquo;s like to have children of my own yet! From conversations I have had with people lately, they have made comments that appear to me as devaluing a family that only consists of husband and wife. It&amp;rsquo;s as if they think a married couple simply on their own isn&amp;rsquo;t good enough, or isn&amp;rsquo;t a &amp;ldquo;family&amp;rdquo; compared to a married couple with children.</description></item><item><title>Invest More in Your Marriage Than in Your Kids</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/invest-more-in-your-marriage-than-in-your-kids/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/invest-more-in-your-marriage-than-in-your-kids/</guid><description>A HAPPY AND HEALTHY FAMILY BEGINS WITH MARRIAGE In the previous post connected to this, I discussed how it&amp;rsquo;s becoming more normal to put less importance on marriage and more importance on kids. I think that this normalized mindset has given people this idea that a family only consisting of a husband and wife isn&amp;rsquo;t good enough compared to a family that has a husband, wife, and kids. NEWSFLASH: Marriage is the foundation of a family, and the most important foundation we will ever build!</description></item><item><title>Meant to be</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/meant-to-be/</link><pubDate>Fri, 24 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/meant-to-be/</guid><description>Sharing time These pictures depict our lives before we &amp;ldquo;re-met&amp;rdquo; and started dating. Trevor was serving a Latter-Day Saint mission across the country while I was living at home, working at a craft store, and riding my scooter around trying to find myself again.
Though it was tough at times, these experiences were great for each of us to gain a new perspective and discover what we really wanted and what we were ready for&amp;hellip; each other.</description></item><item><title>Reaching Your Health Goals: Together or Individually?</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/reaching-your-health-goals-together-or-individually/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/reaching-your-health-goals-together-or-individually/</guid><description>This week I asked how couples get their exercise - do they work out together or individually, and why. The reason I asked is because this is something my husband and I have been trying to figure out for a while now! I&amp;rsquo;ve seen many couples do workouts together, or go on the same diets. I think it&amp;rsquo;s cool to have it be something you can do together because you get healthy while spending time together, you can encourage each other, and it can be convenient to eat the same meals.</description></item><item><title>Being a Married College Student</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/being-a-married-college-student/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 May 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/being-a-married-college-student/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m grateful that I was able to experience college being both single, and then married. In the beginning I was doing the college thing for the experience and learning, but finishing college as a married woman for the last few semesters was for more than that. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t just doing it for me anymore.
The Single College Life People tend to think that it&amp;rsquo;s best to go through college being single, or at least not yet married.</description></item><item><title>The Future is as Bright as Your Faith</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/the-future-is-as-bright-as-your-faith/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/the-future-is-as-bright-as-your-faith/</guid><description>Three years ago I wrote this message to Trevor on the back of a picture quote as encouragement that we could do the long distance thing.

To the people sick of listening to proposal stories, stop rolling your eyes about it.
To the people who joke about my husband and I being prom dates because we sometimes match his tie and my dress for church, stop rolling your eyes about it.
Why am I saying this? Because people tend to get annoyed of young love and it bugs me.</description></item><item><title>Religion Doesn't Guarantee A Lasting Marriage</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/religion-doesnt-guarantee-your-marriage/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/religion-doesnt-guarantee-your-marriage/</guid><description>I was married in a Latter-Day Saint temple, where we believe allows your marriage to be eternal. However, simply having my marriage ceremony within my religion doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean I&amp;rsquo;m guaranteed to have a happy and healthy marriage! Believing you&amp;rsquo;ll have a forever marriage is different from actually creating one.
Principles to follow I firmly know that the principles taught in my Latter-Day Saint faith and many other faiths directly coincide with principles you should follow for a strong and happy marriage.</description></item><item><title>The Importance of Family Photos</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/the-importance-of-family-photos/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/the-importance-of-family-photos/</guid><description>As you have noticed, we got some new family photos done :) And I&amp;rsquo;m loving them! I had been watching my friend Nicky post so many amazing pictures she has taken of families and couples, and knew that she could give us the memorable photos we were looking for.

I also heard great messages about marriage, too!

The shocked part of me thinks: &amp;ldquo;I swear they all just got married yesterday!&amp;rdquo; And then the realistic part of me remembers that high school was 7 years ago and a lot can happen whether people got married right out of high school or more recently. Because I&amp;rsquo;m in this same grouping, it gives me mixed feelings, realizing that divorce truly is a possibility, but that I&amp;rsquo;m glad I have the strong marriage I have.</description></item><item><title>Financial Independence</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/financial-independence/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/financial-independence/</guid><description>In our short three years (almost) being married, Trevor and I have done really well about trying to be financially independent from our families. It&amp;rsquo;s something that had to be done in stages because tackling health insurance, car insurance, and a phone bill all at once is not wise! Health insurance is a headache on its own, am I right?! But slowly we made goals of what responsibilities we needed to take on and when to do it.</description></item><item><title>My Social Media Status Update</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/my-social-media-status-update/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/my-social-media-status-update/</guid><description>Last week I re-shared some posts I wrote a year ago about some struggles I had with social media. I felt envious at times. I felt too involved in people&amp;rsquo;s lives that I hardly talk to anymore. And because I was getting used to a new living situation now knowing anyone, I spent a lot of time seeking comfort from those virtual connections. Unfortunately but understandably, all of this made me depressed so I had to change these thoughts for myself, but also for my marriage because it began to affect that as well.</description></item><item><title>25</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/25-2/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/25-2/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;ve hit the quarter-life mark turning 25 last week and I feel the need to write about it. I have to say that I was not looking forward to this birthday just because the things I was wanting to do /to eat (but for reals!) I couldn&amp;rsquo;t have, or were out of reach. I thought that those things would make me happy. I have to admit that I totally cheated on my birthday and had two slices of cheese pizza that tasted so much like paradise that I didn&amp;rsquo;t even regret the inflammation and discomfort I had from it the next two days!</description></item><item><title>Learning From Mistakes</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/learning-from-mistakes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/learning-from-mistakes/</guid><description>Choose to have learning experiences rather than fights, rather than ruts, rather than mistakes.

You consciously open the drawer to your nightstand and grab a worn letter inside an envelope, fold it in half, and put it inside the back pocket of your jeans.
That might seem like a small little difference to your normal routine, because I don&amp;rsquo;t know anyone who does this, haha.</description></item><item><title>Let It Go</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/let-it-go/</link><pubDate>Fri, 04 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/let-it-go/</guid><description>I know it can be very hard to let little things go, or to let big things go. Overcoming your variety of feelings, is not easy. Forgiveness is not easy! Forgetting is not easy. I know that it&amp;rsquo;s easier to sing it than to do it (sorry not sorry if the song got stuck in your head lol) but once you do let it go, you also have let go of resentment and can move forward with a clearer heart and mind.</description></item><item><title>The Inevitable Storms in Marriage</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/the-inevitable-storms-in-marriage/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Feb 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/the-inevitable-storms-in-marriage/</guid><description>In my previous post, I talked about not holding onto mistakes you have made, or mistakes your spouse has made &amp;ndash; Basically letting go of grudges you have with yourself or your spouse.

When we look at our spouses, we should view them with a sense of compassion, recognizing that they have weaknesses just like you do. And then I hope that compassion turns into excitement thinking about how great your marriage can be; how it can improve and strengthen.

These are the definitions that I found for FRESH, and FRESHEN, and I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you how I interrupt and apply this to marriages.</description></item><item><title>The Six Stages of My Family Planning Journey</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/the-six-stages-of-my-family-planning-journey/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/the-six-stages-of-my-family-planning-journey/</guid><description>If you are like me, you are at the point in your marriage where the idea of having children weighs more heavily on your mind. Whatever the reason for it, getting to this point has been an interesting journey, at least it has been for me! When we first got married the idea of starting a family was a simple goal for us: &amp;ldquo;Not for five years.&amp;rdquo; However as months and months have passed since then, I can tell you now that it&amp;rsquo;s actually not that simple, haha.</description></item><item><title>Yelling is Not Cool</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/yelling-is-not-cool/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/yelling-is-not-cool/</guid><description>Story time When we were living in an apartment still, there was a new family that moved in below us; a wife, husband, and a few kids. Since they moved in, almost every day we heard them yelling. The parents would yell at each other, the parents yelled at the kids, and the kids yelled at the parents. I absolutely hated it; I cringed every time. Yes, I cringed because it is annoying, but mainly because it shows that they are were not loving each other and instead were hurting each other.</description></item><item><title>Because You're Worth It</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/because-youre-worth-it/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/because-youre-worth-it/</guid><description>Three years ago yesterday, Trevor asked me to be his wife! That was obviously a big moment for us, just as it is for any relationship. However, there were other things leading up to that moment that were also big in our relationship.
Story Time Two weeks before he proposed I had finally decided I was ready and wanted to move to be closer to him in Provo. This was a big deal for me because exactly a year prior to that I did the same thing&amp;ndash; move to Provo to be closer to a boy I was ready to marry.</description></item><item><title>Hug More, Kiss More</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/hug-more-kiss-more/</link><pubDate>Sat, 09 Jan 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/hug-more-kiss-more/</guid><description>HUG MORE.

So many people right now are thinking about how they can better themselves for the new year. I am doing that right now, too! But one area people tend to forget to make a resolution for is in their relationships. Do I need to mention how awesome and important that is to do in your MARRIAGE?!

A few that I have received better insight into this year are marriages that have a spouse serving in the armed forces, police work, firefighters, or EMT&amp;rsquo;s. Because of their job description and the sacrifice they make to help protect us, they face different challenges in their marriages than other couples might face. Since I do not have first-hand experience in this area, I asked someone who has absolute experience in this to help us understand better.</description></item><item><title>The Difference Between an Ordinary Marriage and an Extraordinary Marriage</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/the-difference-between-an-ordinary-marriage-and-an-extraordinary-marriage/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/the-difference-between-an-ordinary-marriage-and-an-extraordinary-marriage/</guid><description>When I watch TV shows that portray a husband and wife relationship, I get annoyed sometimes with how they act towards each other. Examples of this: Wives nagging their husbands and saying they don&amp;rsquo;t do anything for them ever. Husbands complaining and saying comments like, “this is torture” when helping their wife plan a party or something only she is really interested in doing. They say sarcastic things under their breath at each other.</description></item><item><title>The Pressures of Newlywed Bucket Lists</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/the-pressures-of-newlywed-bucket-lists/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/the-pressures-of-newlywed-bucket-lists/</guid><description>In case I haven&amp;rsquo;t said this a lot lately, I&amp;rsquo;m super excited to be graduating with my bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in WEEKS.

On our first date, Trevor and I started talking about some things we like to do, and we found most of them we had in common (of course!) Since he had recently come home from serving an Latter-Day Saint mission, I started suggesting some of the movies he should watch and music to listen to that came out while he was gone. It started as that, and then somehow it turned into things that we were possibly going to do together&amp;hellip; :) So being the list people that we are, Trevor pulled out his phone and created a google doc, listing these things to do.</description></item><item><title>Prioritizing My Spouse</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/putting-your-spouse-before-children/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Apr 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/putting-your-spouse-before-children/</guid><description>I used to be one of those people that thought you should do anything and everything for your kids - that they should be the priority. It&amp;rsquo;s portrayed in movies of parents willing to do anything for their kids.

We&amp;rsquo;ve established a grocery budget for every month since we&amp;rsquo;ve been married and I don&amp;rsquo;t think I&amp;rsquo;ve ever truly been able to stay under it, EVER! haha. I even feel like I&amp;rsquo;m fairly frugal in my money-saving strategies. I look through the coupons we get in the mail to see if there&amp;rsquo;s a deal on something we actually use or eat, I&amp;rsquo;ll take advantage of good sales going on and stock up in bulk (one of the big suggestions to saving money on groceries), and I&amp;rsquo;ll avoid getting items sometimes that I think are too expensive that week.</description></item><item><title>Loving at Arms-Length</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/loving-at-arms-length/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Feb 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/loving-at-arms-length/</guid><description>I attended a women&amp;rsquo;s conference with my mom a few weeks ago and I was inspired by one of the speakers who talked about &amp;ldquo;loving at arms-length.&amp;rdquo; It was actually Dawn Armstrong, the mother of the missionary from the movie, &amp;ldquo;Meet the Mormons.&amp;rdquo; She talked about how she has a lot of love for so many people; sometimes people who randomly come along.

All the pictures and artwork have been taken down from the walls, leaving them as blank as a piece of paper. Our couch has been sold, so movies are being watched in our bed now. The shelves have been cleared, and the drawers are empty. Clothes are in bags, appliances are wrapped up, and the random things are boxed up..

The price gets higher and higher with every new appliance or furniture purchase, too. After buying the necessary refrigerator, washer and dryer, and a couch, you could say our savings is getting depleted! Even though we have the money for it, and are being responsible, it&amp;rsquo;s put us on a tight budget this month and next month, as we make sure we have enough money for all the living essentials and closing costs coming up.</description></item><item><title>Defending Motherhood</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/defending-motherhood/</link><pubDate>Sun, 03 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/defending-motherhood/</guid><description>Pregnancy.

Whether the news is for yourself or for someone else, it is really exciting to see one of God&amp;rsquo;s greatest miracles happening to someone you know, and someone you care about. One of my friends and past roommates recently found out she is pregnant :) I&amp;rsquo;m so happy for her to be a mom because I know without a doubt, that is her mission in life.</description></item><item><title>Our House Story Part 2: You Can Learn a Lot in Four Days</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/our-house-story-part-2-you-can-learn-a-lot-in-four-days/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/our-house-story-part-2-you-can-learn-a-lot-in-four-days/</guid><description>If you read Part 1, you&amp;rsquo;ll know that we went into our appointment feeling worried about the huge price increase on the home plan we were interested in the most.

It really felt like everything was about timing. We weren&amp;rsquo;t sure if the timing was right with me going back to school. We also weren&amp;rsquo;t sure if we should save up a little more, though we did already have a down payment.</description></item><item><title>Home is {insert cliche here}</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/home-is-insert-cliche-here/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jul 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/home-is-insert-cliche-here/</guid><description>Ready for these two exciting announcements?
We are moving! We bought a house! Yep. This just got real. It&amp;rsquo;s awesome yet crazy, and just a huge step in our lives but we are so excited to take that step! Though the idea of moving has been in the works for us for about five months, the opportunity with this specific house came up quick. And when I mean quick, I mean that we had three days to decide on it, haha.</description></item><item><title>Starting Our Second Year</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/starting-our-second-year/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/starting-our-second-year/</guid><description>We are now on month 13 and I&amp;rsquo;m feeling grateful for where we are at. It is funny because this month I&amp;rsquo;ve suddenly felt like we gained a little bit more maturity with completing one year. Every year brings it&amp;rsquo;s certain experiences that allow us to learn and grow, so each year we&amp;rsquo;ll become just a little tinsy-tiny bit more wiser than the year before, and I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to it :) With that being said, I think it is important to look back at things we have learned.</description></item><item><title>Save It For Your Husband</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/save-it-for-your-husband/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Jun 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/save-it-for-your-husband/</guid><description>Feel free to LISTEN to this blog post below!

I don&amp;rsquo;t like bikinis, I don&amp;rsquo;t wear them. I think they are immodest and inappropriate and impractical to be wearing swimming.

It&amp;rsquo;s an interesting feeling of happiness, pride, excitement, and weirdness at the same time&amp;hellip; if that makes any sense, haha.

There&amp;rsquo;s so much importance that is stressed on getting an education, and going to school. It&amp;rsquo;s something that seems to be on every young-adult&amp;rsquo;s mind, because getting a degree is the next step after high school. It&amp;rsquo;s what everyone is doing, right? Well, not everyone.
It can be harder to accomplish this personal goal when married. The typical cycle around here, is that some couples find it best to have one spouse put school on hold to help support the other spouse&amp;rsquo;s education, with the hope that when they finish, the other spouse can go back and finish.</description></item><item><title>The Working Family</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/the-working-family/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Apr 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/the-working-family/</guid><description>I currently work at a desk job, answering emails and phone calls from customers.

They are GOOD changes! We&amp;rsquo;ve been married now for about 8 months, and it&amp;rsquo;s been a fun ride. While the transition from the single life to the married life was so awesome, it was a bigger transition for me with how independent of a person I am. One of the biggest changes I&amp;rsquo;ve been proud of, is how much I have cut out of my life to make more time for Trevor, and to be a better wife and friend for him&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve focused more on the things that matter most.</description></item><item><title>Married at 22, And Proud of It</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/married-at-22-and-proud-of-it/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jan 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/married-at-22-and-proud-of-it/</guid><description>I&amp;rsquo;m sure many of you have read that article circulating, called &amp;ldquo;23 Things to Do Instead of Getting Engaged Before You&amp;rsquo;re 23.&amp;rdquo; If you haven&amp;rsquo;t read it, you might find it interesting.

This article is something that was posted in the Deseret Newspaper in Salt Lake City, Utah, the other day, and I just wanted to share it.
Though I’m not sure that I agree with titling these “marriage commandments,” I do think it’s a great suggestion to compare them to the ten commandments we have been taught about through the gospel.</description></item><item><title>Never Stop Holding Hands</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/never-stop-holding-hands/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/never-stop-holding-hands/</guid><description>What does it mean when you hold hands with your spouse? I remember the first time that Amy and I held hands. We had been dating for a few weeks and were really starting to like each other. I was shy and didn&amp;rsquo;t know how to make any moves. Amy could see that I was struggling so she helped me: we were watching a movie sitting on a bean bag and she put her hand on my arm.</description></item><item><title>Five Tips To Financial Peace In Marriage</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/five-tips-to-financial-peace-in-marriage/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Oct 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/five-tips-to-financial-peace-in-marriage/</guid><description>A study by University of Utah professor Jeffrey Dew showed that if you argue about money with your spouse more than once a week your risk for divorce is 30 percent higher than if you argue about money with your spouse a few times a month.
So, how can we avoid this? How can we find financial peace in our marriages?

The funny part is that Trevor wants two, and I think that I like three! What’s even more funny is that every now and then, we come across a scene that could give us a great reason to want as few kids as possible, haha. And when that happens, Trevor just holds up 2 fingers at me, and smiles.</description></item><item><title>Preparing For The Zombie Apocalypse</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/preparing-for-the-zombie-apocalypse/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/preparing-for-the-zombie-apocalypse/</guid><description>You don’t hear about many newlywed couples who have food storage, but we are now one of those couples. We’ve been planning since before we got married, to have a three-month supply of food storage, and we just reached that goal this week. No, this isn’t because we worry that a zombie apocalypse will occur. It’s because we fear the unknown.
I know many of you think that the topic of food storage is one that older people are involved in.</description></item><item><title>Note To Self</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/note-to-self/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/note-to-self/</guid><description>Remember to cut the price tag off of your brand new blouse before you wear it to Sacrament meeting, in giving a talk at the pulpit, in front of a large congregation.
It’s fine. My husband slyly pulled it off after I sat back down.
Well, the time came, sooner than I had expected, that we were asked to speak in Sacrament meeting. To many of you, this may surprise you, but we actually enjoyed it.</description></item><item><title>The Three Week Milestone</title><link>https://freshlymarried.github.io/the-three-week-milestone/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://freshlymarried.github.io/the-three-week-milestone/</guid><description>In the first three weeks of being married, I learned: The difference between wants and needs. Showing your love can sometimes be more important than saying it. Selfishness will never prosper in a partnership.

I KNOW RIGHT?! He really is the cutest husband. We had our partial date tonight in the park, having a picnic together. We grabbed the cute woven basket my cute mother-in-law gave us, and packed it full of buns, bananas, and BBQ chicken. It was lovely just sitting on the lush, green, grass, just eating, talking, and laughing. Trevor makes me giggle so much.</description></item></channel></rss>
