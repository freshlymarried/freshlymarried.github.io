People have been asking how I am doing since I have been absent from posting much on the Freshly Married website and social media. And to answer everyone, I am doing GREAT! Some days are anxiety-ridden and November to mid-December we’re pretty tiring ( #sleepregression ). But we have been just enjoying life altogether regardless.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/twin-baby-registry/ class="link black dim">Twin Baby Registry</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This post contains affiliate links to Amazon.

Well we are pretty much all prepared for our boys to come! At least, with the material items and their room &mldr; mentally, I’m not sure yet! Haha. It feels weird that at 31 weeks we already bought everything on our registry that was left over from the generous gifts we received at our baby showers!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/10-tips-for-going-through-fertility-treatments/ class="link black dim">10 Tips for Going Through Fertility Treatments</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A Little Bit of Our Story It took 2.5 years of trying to conceive (TTC) to get to this amazing point of being pregnant with identical twin boys! We feel absolutely blessed that we get two babies as a result of our hard work with the Utah Fertility Center. We did 3 timed intercourse cycles that required more and more pills and shots each time, but lead us to our first try at Intrauterine Insemination (IUI).</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/gender-reveal/ class="link black dim">Gender Reveal!</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Everything about this pregnancy has been super exciting, not just for us but for our family and friends. I mean, it took us so much to finally get here, but we also get to experience the rare situation of twins! It&rsquo;s also my in-laws&rsquo; first grandbaby so it&rsquo;s ALL very exciting for them.
So of course, we did a gender reveal party to share the sex of our identical twins with our family!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/my-words-of-the-year/ class="link black dim">My Words of The Year</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Now that the secret is out that I’m pregnant with twins I can finally share my words of the year because it has everything to do with them. :) I say WORDS because I think it&rsquo;s important to have a goal in mind for you as an individual, and then a goal in mind for your marriage. However you like to do your goals, whether by choosing a specific word to inspire you, a vision board, or simply writing down the goal in a sentence, make sure you are considering how you can strengthen your marriage.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/4-reasons-you-should-write-a-will-how-to-do-it/ class="link black dim">4 Reasons You Should Write a Will & How to do it</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Discussing the topic of dying is kind of depressing, I know. But death is also a reality. And unfortunately, for so many couples, it becomes a reality too early on in their marriage, and so unexpectedly. You can only prepare so much in these situations, but guess what? Making a will is something that you CAN prepare for.
After learning about wills and estates in a family finances class, I started realizing how important it is to have a will in place for your family’s protection, especially if you have many assets you want to leave behind for your spouse and children.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-22/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 22</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The joy I found in my marriage this week is seeing the door to parenthood open wider. There were two reasons for this joy. This has been our first full week with our new dog, Oli. And though Trevor does most of the responsibilities, we&rsquo;ve both had our eyes further opened to what being a parent is like. Being a &ldquo;dog parent&rdquo; I guess you could say, is a great segway into being a parent for a human, haha.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-16/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 16</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Something that I found joy in is actually something that initially bugs me. And others may not understand it but I&rsquo;ve just gotta share this thought.
Stop devaluing your relationship with your spouse This week I&rsquo;ve heard many people say things like, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember what life was like before our kids.&rdquo; and other similar phrases. And it makes me sad when people say that, believe it or not. I get that it&rsquo;s a loving way of trying to say that children have enriched your life in a way that you would never want to change, and that you can&rsquo;t imagine life without them.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/spotlight-marriage-parenthood-and-postpartum-depression/ class="link black dim">Spotlight: Marriage, Parenthood, and Postpartum Depression</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I asked Kinsey the following question: “How has having children changed your relationship for the better and how has it challenged your relationship?” What she answered with was absolutely amazing insight and advice when it comes to balancing parenthood and marriage. She also shared the very personal and difficult challenges of battling severe Postpartum Depression and how she plans to handle that with their third baby on the way. All of this makes Kinsey a warrior woman in my eyes!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/6-ways-to-prioritize-your-spouse/ class="link black dim">6 Ways to Prioritize Your Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A reader asked what I would suggest as ways to prioritize your spouse, and I decided to put all that information in a post because my reply is too big for a comment box! haha. So here&rsquo;s my reply to my previous post: &ldquo;Prioritizing My Spouse.&rdquo;
The idea of growing apart happens gradually over time. When you think about it, there will always be sudden situations that come up where you do need to be there for your kids over your spouse, but I think the problem starts when this is happening frequently.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/if-you-havent-been-on-a-date-in-awhile.../ class="link black dim">If You Haven't Been On a Date in Awhile...</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">To the couples who haven&rsquo;t gone on a date in awhile:
GO ON A DATE! I know I say this a lot, and I don&rsquo;t want to come off as annoying, judge-y or insensitive when I write this post. Life can be tough and in those tough times, we tend to put this incredibly important relationship of ours on the back-burner. It also happens when life is busy. For whatever the reason, these situations start to take precedence over something that is so essential to a relationship.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-six-stages-of-my-family-planning-journey/ class="link black dim">The Six Stages of My Family Planning Journey</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">If you are like me, you are at the point in your marriage where the idea of having children weighs more heavily on your mind. Whatever the reason for it, getting to this point has been an interesting journey, at least it has been for me! When we first got married the idea of starting a family was a simple goal for us: &ldquo;Not for five years.&rdquo; However as months and months have passed since then, I can tell you now that it&rsquo;s actually not that simple, haha.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-pressures-of-newlywed-bucket-lists/ class="link black dim">The Pressures of Newlywed Bucket Lists</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">In case I haven&rsquo;t said this a lot lately, I&rsquo;m super excited to be graduating with my bachelor&rsquo;s degree in WEEKS.

Overtime this philosophy has changed for me, especially since finding Trevor.

Some of them are just funny little grandmas just waiting to have more cheeks to pinch!

I have learned a few things in my life about families, especially recently.
Every family is different Every family has some sort of challenge, obstacle, or trial to overcome. Growing up, I quickly learned the first part. My family and I have experienced certain trials that I know many of my friends and their families were not experiencing, at the time.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/some-peoples-kids/ class="link black dim">Some People's Kids</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We aren’t quite sure about how many kids we will want to have, when the time comes.
