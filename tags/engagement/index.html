depict our lives before we &ldquo;re-met&rdquo; and started dating. Trevor was serving a Latter-Day Saint mission across the country while I was living at home, working at a craft store, and riding my scooter around trying to find myself again.
Though it was tough at times, these experiences were great for each of us to gain a new perspective and discover what we really wanted and what we were ready for&mldr; each other.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-future-is-as-bright-as-your-faith/ class="link black dim">The Future is as Bright as Your Faith</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Three years ago I wrote this message to Trevor on the back of a picture quote as encouragement that we could do the long distance thing. (I&rsquo;m sad we can&rsquo;t find the original right now but glad I took a picture of the smeared message I wrote him!) The story behind this little message set a precedent for our relationship and it&rsquo;s one I think every couple needs reminding of :)</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/wedding-rings-more-than-a-piece-of-jewelry/ class="link black dim">Wedding Rings: More Than a Piece of Jewelry</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The day I was proposed to, the day I gave Trevor his wedding ring, and the day I got married to him were all days that showed me the meaning of a wedding ring.

While watching an episode of &ldquo;Duck Dynasty&rdquo; with my dad! hahaha. I&rsquo;ll explain.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/because-youre-worth-it/ class="link black dim">Because You're Worth It</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Three years ago yesterday, Trevor asked me to be his wife! That was obviously a big moment for us, just as it is for any relationship. However, there were other things leading up to that moment that were also big in our relationship.
Story Time Two weeks before he proposed I had finally decided I was ready and wanted to move to be closer to him in Provo. This was a big deal for me because exactly a year prior to that I did the same thing&ndash; move to Provo to be closer to a boy I was ready to marry.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-hunt-is-over/ class="link black dim">The Hunt Is Over</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This blog post contains affiliate links. Hi. Wedding shower fun here! Last weekend I threw my SIL a bridal shower and it was great! I literally spent two months planning and getting excited to do it because I had a fun idea that was unique to her and unique to bridal showers in general. She LOVES hunting, fishing, that outdoorsy stuff, AND perfectly enough &mdash; her fiance loves all of that too!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/married-at-22-and-proud-of-it/ class="link black dim">Married at 22, And Proud of It</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m sure many of you have read that article circulating, called &ldquo;23 Things to Do Instead of Getting Engaged Before You&rsquo;re 23.&rdquo; If you haven&rsquo;t read it, you might find it interesting.

Photography Pictures were taken with family and friends on the temple grounds, and afterwards, Trevor and I spent about an hour taking pictures just us and the photographer.
