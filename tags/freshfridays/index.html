nested-copy-line-height">#freshfridays quote asking &ldquo;Have you had your six-second kiss today?&rdquo;
I don&rsquo;t think we should look at the word &lsquo;potential&rsquo; with an eye-roll, because it doesn&rsquo;t mean a long kiss has to lead to sex. An extra long kiss is just more special than the quick kiss goodbye or quick kiss when getting home from work.
So I think the &lsquo;potential&rsquo; he&rsquo;s referring to is focused more on how that kind of intentional and more meaningful kiss can lead to a more meaningful relationship; more meaningful days together; more meaningful emotional intimacy.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-taking-turns/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: Taking Turns</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This is the beauty of marriage right here. I remember being single not having a consistent person to rely on. Yes, I had loving family and friends but they also have their own lives and their own problems. In marriage, though, your spouse becomes your number one priority and so you get to experience that loving feeling of being taken care of.
There are days where I feel bad that my husband has to deal with my bad days whether I&rsquo;m either emotionally down in the dumps, or just not feeling well physically.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-in-the-middle-of-difficulty/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays quote: In The Middle of Difficulty</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever stop getting inspired by quotes that remind me to look for the lesson through hard times!
If we apply this to marriage, I think the opportunity that #alberteinstein is talking about here are the opportunities to learn something about yourself, your spouse, or the issue.
If our difficulty is disagreeing on something important, I get the chance to see another perspective I didn&rsquo;t see before. I also get the chance to analyze myself and how I can improve.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-branches-vs-roots/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: Branches vs. Roots</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This quote below is great to remember in times of disconnection and conflict. We try to look on their surface for any emotion to provide us with answers, but what&rsquo;s showing on the outside might not be how they actually feel or think.
You may think &ldquo;He looks like he could care less right now! He&rsquo;s stone-cold to me and doesn&rsquo;t care about a resolution OR ME!&rdquo; That might be what it looks like on the surface.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quotes-hopes-not-fears/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quotes: hopes, not fears</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">There are many choices and decisions to make that come throughout every marriage. Which is why I love this #freshfridays quote.
When we make choices based on our fears it&rsquo;s coming from a place of doubt. But when we make choices based on our hopes, it&rsquo;s coming from a place of faith. Total opposites that can greatly change an attitude and even an outcome, right?
I&rsquo;ve been working on changing this way of thinking for myself lately.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-we-were-together/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: We Were Together</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Social media can make it seem like our marriages aren&rsquo;t fun or entertaining enough, as if the time we do get with each other doesn&rsquo;t matter if it wasn&rsquo;t elaborate, if it wasn&rsquo;t longer than an hour, or if the weekend was spent inside even though it&rsquo;s beautiful outside. It&rsquo;s easy to feel like that when your life is busy, or if there is something lacking in your relationship.

This question is so important to the #freshlymarried perspective! I believe that our daily positive actions add up to create a strong marriage, and asking ourselves this question can help us do that.
For those of you wondering what the word &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; has to do with my overall marriage message, you can read more here :) But using a quick example: when restaurants have items specifically made fresh that day and not days earlier, that&rsquo;s a restaurant you want to eat at, right?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-i-have-a-choice/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: I Have a Choice</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I want to gear this #freshfridays quote towards our emotions. No one is in control of our emotions except for ourselves. So when we react terribly towards something our spouse says or does, we have to own that. That’s why I love this quote, reminding me that I get to choose how I react to a situation, but that my choice is also important.
There&rsquo;s a few types of choices, I believe.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-marriage-is-like-home-maintenance/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: Marriage is Like Home Maintenance</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The smoke detectors in our house have slowly been going off over the past few months, needing a replacement battery. And boy was that fun in the beginning :) I remember the first one that starting chirping during the day while it was just me at home, and I couldn&rsquo;t replace the battery because I wasn&rsquo;t tall enough to reach it, haha. So I had to wait until Trevor got home because he could reach it.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-look-for-the-virtues/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: Look For The Virtues</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">“…There would be far less of divorce, much less of infidelity, much less of anger and rancor and quarreling.

Looking for the good in your spouse daily — YES that’s DEFINITELY a smart technique to use in marriage!
Look for the good, look for the positive, and look for the reasons why you fell in love with them in the first place.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-remember-the-first-day/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: Remember The First Day</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I hope you all enjoy your own trip down #memory lane with this #freshfridays thought :)</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-what-will-you-do-this-anniversary-to-keep-your-marriage-fresh/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays: What Will You Do This Anniversary to Keep Your Marriage Fresh?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">You all know what we already did for our #anniversary to keep it fresh - romantic vacay to Hawaii!
