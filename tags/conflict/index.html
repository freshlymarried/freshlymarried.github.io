It seems everyone is affected one way or another from the COVID-19 global pandemic. Some people are affected financially with job loss or revenue. Some people are affected with loss of loved ones or even just the loss of a social life. Some people are missing out on important milestones and celebrated events like weddings and even prom.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-game-manual-for-marriage/ class="link black dim">The Game Manual For Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Every card game and board game comes with instructions or a manual so that every player can understand how to play the game.

While there are a variety of reasons why problems occur in this department, I believe there are three big areas that contribute to problems: safety, communication, and the influences around us.
SAFETY In order to have a healthy sexual communication between you and your spouse, there needs to be strong feelings of safety in the marriage.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/decision-making-the-three-legged-race-in-marriage/ class="link black dim">Decision-Making: The Three-Legged Race in Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The learning curve I think one of the biggest learning curves of newlyweds is decision-making. Of course, you had to make decisions before when you were dating and engaged, but it can be different because the stakes are different. And I think when a person is so smitten with someone, they are more likely to bend to the other person, haha.
The biggest difference when it comes to decision making in marriage is that you now have so many things you&rsquo;re making decisions about, all involving and affecting the other person.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/dont-be-intimidated-4-misunderstandings-about-relationship-education/ class="link black dim">Don't Be Intimidated: 4 Misunderstandings About Relationship Education</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Most people don&rsquo;t know the underlying reason for Freshly Married being here. It&rsquo;s because relationship education is important! And yet so many people have either never heard of it before, are intimidated by it, scared of it, or assume it means you have relationship problems you need help with. WELL NEWSFLASH, WE ALL HAVE PROBLEMS! haha. But really.
Because I believe passionately that relationship education is a helpful tool for all relationships, not just marriage, I want to explain what relationship education is while addressing some misunderstandings so that you can feel more comfortable with seeking help.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/3-tips-for-preventing-holiday-stress-from-affecting-your-marriage/ class="link black dim">3 Tips For Preventing Holiday Stress From Affecting Your Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We are all well aware that while the holiday season can be a wonderful time of year spent with loved ones, it can also bring with it some stress. Just a few examples: spending hours trying to make your house look festive; thinking of the perfect gifts for family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers, then having to go get those gifts and wrap them, while trying to not spend a fortune; making special food for the celebrations; and feeling pressure to make special memories.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/important-thoughts-on-success-and-failure-in-marriage/ class="link black dim">Important Thoughts on Success and Failure in Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I was recently reading an old interview with actress Jennifer Garner in Vanity Fair on her marriage to Ben Affleck. As you probably know, they split up after ten years of marriage, sadly. It&rsquo;s something that I can tell she really wanted to work out, especially already having a previous divorce under her belt. She said some very mature and admirable things about their marriage and their divorce, but her overall statement made my heart break with confusion.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/spotlight-learning-from-a-parents-divorce-part-1/ class="link black dim">Spotlight: Learning From a Parents' Divorce (Part 1)</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A divorce is an event that affects so many people and for years to come. It’s something very common, yet it’s very scary to talk about for many people. It’s a topic I’ve been wanting to tackle for awhile, but contains so many aspects to cover. I&rsquo;ve always been curious about how children, adolescents, and adult children have been affected by their parents&rsquo; divorce. So I&rsquo;ve enlisted the help of some amazing women who are kind enough to share their experiences with you, to give you better insight into this particular family situation.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/spotlight-learning-from-a-parents-divorce-part-2/ class="link black dim">Spotlight: Learning From a Parents' Divorce (Part 2)</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">If you didn’t catch part 1 reading some great insight and advice from both Brooke and Kristin, you should go read that!

This Spotlight Part 2 perspective is getting some insight from two women who were adults and married or almost married when their parents got a divorce.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/when-one-spouse-wants-sex-more-than-the-other/ class="link black dim">When One Spouse Wants Sex More Than The Other</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links.
A very common complaint among married couples, especially couples that have sexual intimacy problems, is that one spouse seems to want or enjoy sex more than their spouse does. This scenario is a difficult one to provide a one-size-fits-all answer to because there are two different perspectives, with a variety of possible reasons or causes of this gap, and a variety of ideas on how to tackle this situation!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/spotlight-the-unique-marriage-of-living-with-mental-illness/ class="link black dim">Spotlight: The Unique Marriage of Living With Mental Illness</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The times when I think marriage can get the toughest is when spouses are not sharing the same viewpoint, or when one spouse is struggling physically or mentally. Both of these tough situations are prevalent in a marriage that has one or both spouses struggling with mental illness. As I&rsquo;ve shared in a few articles on depression, it&rsquo;s not easy for either spouse to handle, and it truly can affect your marriage in the short-term AND long-term of your relationship.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/4-mistakes-we-make-when-a-friends-marriage-is-struggling/ class="link black dim">4 Mistakes We Make When a Friend’s Marriage is Struggling</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">It’s not easy to see your friends go through hard struggles, especially when it comes to such an important relationship like marriage. It’s also not easy to be the confidant, the person they choose to share their marital struggles with. Though I think you should try avoiding involving your friends in the personal details of your marriage, it’s a reality that friends will confide in you and you will confide in them.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/2-big-tips-when-resolving-conflicts/ class="link black dim">2 Big Tips When Resolving Conflicts</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When you&rsquo;re in the middle of a fight or disagreement and things get heated, uncomfortable, or you just can&rsquo;t find a mutual solution, what do you do?
Some spouses let their frustrations escalate to the point where they say things they later regret. Sometimes one spouse completely shuts down and stops talking altogether. Sometimes the conflict never gets discussed again because the issue caused so much stress and problems. What&rsquo;s interesting, about that, is this IMPORTANT thing to remember:</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/how-to-be-your-spouses-first-responder/ class="link black dim">How To Be Your Spouse's First Responder</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Last month, I read an article about parents needing to be their child’s “first responder” in a crisis. What they meant is that the first reaction shouldn’t be to yell at them for the situation, but instead, you should first help them.
I can absolutely attest that this concept works because my parents did this for me as a teenager. Since I have always loved this concept, I applied this idea to marriage, of course!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/3-ways-couples-therapy-can-empower-marriage-even-before-the-first-session/ class="link black dim">3 Ways Couples Therapy Can Empower Marriage, Even Before The First Session</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">One day I was flipping through an article on long-lasting celebrity couples, and each couple said something that has helped them be successful in their marriage. Some of the reasons were good, but this one by actor Bryan Cranston (from TV shows Malcolm in the Middle, and Breaking Bad) and his wife of 27 years stuck out to me.
Whether or not couples therapy is successful for them (it seems like it is since they are still married), this statement is so powerful!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/9-misconceptions-about-therapy/ class="link black dim">9 Misconceptions About Therapy</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">To say there are so many stereotypes and stigmas out there associated with therapists and therapy is an understatement. Therapists are often portrayed in movies and TV shows as jokes, and I&rsquo;m not sure why, because seeking help for your mental and emotional state of mind is not a casual or comical thing! It&rsquo;s also just as important to keep yourself emotionally healthy as it is to keep yourself physically healthy!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/seeing-a-therapist-my-own-experiences/ class="link black dim">Seeing a Therapist: My Own Experiences</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I am sharing my experiences because I believe that the more positively we talk about therapy, the less stigma attached to it, and the more likely people are to seek help and actually get the help they need. I have seen a therapist at two different times in my life, and each time was for emotionally difficult situations. I ask for your sensitivity as I get very vulnerable here!
(Just to preface this, I&rsquo;ll refer to both counseling and therapy as one sometimes, just so it&rsquo;s more simple to read, but the two professions are slightly different.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/disapproving-parents-how-to-handle-it-and-why-you-should-do-that-now/ class="link black dim">Disapproving Parents: How to Handle it and Why You Should Do That Now</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">My heart hurts every time I hear my friends, neighbors, etc. tell me that their parents still don&rsquo;t approve of their spouse. It&rsquo;s hard to listen to them tell me things like, &ldquo;They think he isn&rsquo;t good enough for me&rdquo; or &ldquo;They tried to break us up.&rdquo; These kinds of family situations frustrate me primarily because HELLO PARENTS, IT&rsquo;S AFTER-THE-FACT! THEY HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR YEARS NOW, SO PUT ASIDE YOUR OWN FEELINGS AND SUPPORT THEM INSTEAD OF DISCOURAGE THEM!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-in-the-middle-of-difficulty/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays quote: In The Middle of Difficulty</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever stop getting inspired by quotes that remind me to look for the lesson through hard times!
If we apply this to marriage, I think the opportunity that #alberteinstein is talking about here are the opportunities to learn something about yourself, your spouse, or the issue.
If our difficulty is disagreeing on something important, I get the chance to see another perspective I didn&rsquo;t see before. I also get the chance to analyze myself and how I can improve.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-perfectly-imperfect-reminder/ class="link black dim">A Perfectly Imperfect Reminder</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Today is a special day :) Four years ago on October 25th, Trevor and I made our relationship official.

This idea can also be applied to your personal roles, such as being a spouse.

What I mean by this is that sometimes when we try bringing up an issue with our spouse, we start it off with blaming or obvious anger. Think of the last time you started off a conversation like this. How did it work out for you?? If a conversation starts off like this, it will most likely end like this too.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/marital-tiffs-and-beautiful-beaches/ class="link black dim">Marital Tiffs and Beautiful Beaches</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Arguments, fights, tiffs, quarrels, disagreements, misunderstandings, whatever you call them, are bound to happen here and there in marriage.

Is anyone else losing faith in marriage, too?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/same-sex-marriage-doesnt-change-my-traditional-marriage/ class="link black dim">Same-sex Marriage Doesn't Change My Traditional Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Marriage has gone down in history this week with the legalization of same-sex marriages throughout the nation. The past few days I&rsquo;ve been thinking about two things: 1) We are all human and we all have rights, despite our sexual orientation or religious beliefs. 2) How this is an opportune moment for us to increase our appreciation for marriage in general (traditional or non-traditional).
Recognizing the responsibilities Marriage is a big deal to me.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/my-struggle-with-social-media-part-3/ class="link black dim">My Struggle With Social Media: Part 3</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This is the last post in a series of three posts on this subject.

How social media has affected my marriage Trevor and I differ on our level of social interaction.

All the world&rsquo;s a stage I think each of us are on a stage. We give a public presentation of ourselves to an audience &ndash; the people walking by us on the streets, our co-workers, friends, family, and our virtual friends on social media. When we go out on stage, we pick the parts of ourselves that we want people to see.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/my-struggle-with-social-media-part-1/ class="link black dim">My Struggle With Social Media: Part 1</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">From about September to December, I really struggled emotionally with social media. I fell into some common pitfalls of comparing my life to other people&rsquo;s lives, questioning how &ldquo;real&rdquo; people were, and spending more time being involved in it than I should have (though I wouldn&rsquo;t say I was addicted). These things were lowering my self-worth, and making me feel ungrateful. I snapped out of this phase and realized some important things that have made me and my marriage happier.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/relationship-enhancement-workshop/ class="link black dim">Relationship Enhancement Workshop</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m suuuuuper excited to announce that I am now a PREP trained facilitator!

Back in college I had to do an assignment relating marriage and relationships to something. It could be an object or an action, we just had to explain why. I found a lot of similarities between hiking and marriage so I wrote all those down here for you! :)
It&rsquo;s a crazy, fun, stressful, scary, beautiful adventure together.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/relationship-whiz/ class="link black dim">Relationship Whiz?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">So remember how I am working on a degree in Family Studies, studying all relationships that come with that, and becoming an expert on how to have a good marriage? Yeah, well just because I&rsquo;m gaining knowledge, it doesn&rsquo;t mean it&rsquo;s easy to apply to my own marriage ;)
On a daily basis I find myself learning something neat about normal family functioning, and how to handle relationships. And of course, when I&rsquo;m learning all of it, I think of the various relationships I have that apply to that idea, and it helps me understand and remember the concept better.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-honeymoon-phase/ class="link black dim">The Honeymoon phase</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When you think about a typical honeymoon (or look back on your own honeymoon), it&rsquo;s a pretty great experience :) This picture is of us on our honeymoon to Park City; a.k.a Our best vacation ever! Honeymoons are full of fun, low-stress, and are fairly worry-free because the happiness of being together outweighs everything. That happiness continues on after the vacation is over. Hence, the &ldquo;honeymoon phase&rdquo; phrase, haha. It was such a simple time.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-four-horsemen/ class="link black dim">The Four Horsemen</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links. A research team under John Gottman, a well-known expert in couples research, found that, &ldquo;the success or failure of a marriage depends not on whether there is conflict, but on how conflict is handled when it does occur (Walsh, 2012).&rdquo; Because of that, Gottman has addressed the mistakes we make while in the middle of marital conflict, in hopes that we can correct our mistakes and live happier marriages.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/defending-motherhood/ class="link black dim">Defending Motherhood</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Pregnancy.

It&rsquo;s possibly because I have had a few conversations with different couples the past month on how they run their finances.

 68% of the divorces involved one party meeting a new lover over the Internet.  56% involved one party having &ldquo;an obsessive interest in pornographic websites.&rdquo; These statistics are disgusting and sad.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/you-are-perfect-for-me/ class="link black dim">You Are Perfect For Me</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">It’s November, which means most of us express extra gratitude for all of the blessings we have in our lives.

I have several moments where I have so much gratitude for my spouse that I want to shout to the world, “I have the cutest husband!” However, I’m realizing that a better, more respectful thing to say, would be something along the lines of, “My husband is perfect for me” or “I’m so thankful for my husband.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-compromise-of-2013/ class="link black dim">The Compromise Of 2013</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Do you and your significant other have different likes and dislikes?

Every family is different Every family has some sort of challenge, obstacle, or trial to overcome. Growing up, I quickly learned the first part.

I never knew everything that goes into making sure you don’t pay a million dollars for small medical services.
