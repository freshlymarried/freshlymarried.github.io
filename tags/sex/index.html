While there are a variety of reasons why problems occur in this department, I believe there are three big areas that contribute to problems: safety, communication, and the influences around us.
SAFETY In order to have a healthy sexual communication between you and your spouse, there needs to be strong feelings of safety in the marriage.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/why-your-spouse-wont-be-your-everything/ class="link black dim">Why Your Spouse Won't Be Your Everything</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I was watching an awesome TED talk from Belgian Psychotherapist, Esther Perel about desire in committed relationships. Specifically talking about having more desire and passion for intimacy. But she mentioned some REALLY great points that completely resonated with me, and I think they will with you too.
She talks about how as humans we have two fundamental human needs that conflict with each other when we are in a committed relationship.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/when-one-spouse-wants-sex-more-than-the-other/ class="link black dim">When One Spouse Wants Sex More Than The Other</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links.
A very common complaint among married couples, especially couples that have sexual intimacy problems, is that one spouse seems to want or enjoy sex more than their spouse does. This scenario is a difficult one to provide a one-size-fits-all answer to because there are two different perspectives, with a variety of possible reasons or causes of this gap, and a variety of ideas on how to tackle this situation!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/how-often-should-you-be-having-sex/ class="link black dim">How Often Should You Be Having Sex?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links. I think two big questions that married couples, especially newlyweds, have on their minds when it comes to sex are:
How often or frequent should we be having sex? Does more sex make for a happier marriage? I’m going to give some insight that can help answer these two questions if you have been asking them yourself!
THE FACTS + FINDINGS There are several studies that have been done out there to determine what the &ldquo;magic number&rdquo; is for answering this question.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/video-books-i-recommend-for-sexual-intimacy-help/ class="link black dim">Video: Books I Recommend For Sexual Intimacy Help</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links.
In March I did a live video on Facebook talking about different books on sexual intimacy that I would recommend to couples. There was great feedback on that video, and it sounded like several people appreciated it! So I wanted to make sure it was published on my website for others to access as well.
I only share three books in this video, but I think they are so great for helping couples enrich their sexual intimacy, whether this part of their marriage is heavily struggling, or they could just use some more insight.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/taking-responsibility-for-your-sexuality/ class="link black dim">Taking Responsibility For Your Sexuality</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links.
I think one of the biggest hangups a couple can have when it comes to their sex life is not understanding their own sexuality first. It makes me sad that so many married people don’t even understand this huge part of their life and who they are. Which is like, the basis of a satisfying sex life for both husband and wife!
Why it&rsquo;s important SOOOO I want to talk just a little bit about this.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/selflessness-the-key-to-great-emotional-physical-intimacy/ class="link black dim">Selflessness: The Key to Great Emotional & Physical Intimacy</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links.
I truly believe in selflessness. I’ve spoken about this before on different videos and blog post topics because pride or selflessness influences every single aspect of marriage!
I believe that when both spouses are being selfless, it can begin this beautiful cycle of deeper connection and more physical satisfaction. What was that last feeling? Physical satisfaction? YEP. Let’s talk about it!
To apply this “cycle” to sexual intimacy, if you are putting your spouse first, wanting them to have a satisfying experience, they will want to give you a satisfying experience right back.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-sexy-dice-game/ class="link black dim">The Sexy Dice Game</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m excited to share this idea with you guys because I think it&rsquo;s a fun, EASY way to switch things up when it comes to your sex life!
For whatever reason, we all experience a hiatus of sexual intimacy at times. Sometimes it&rsquo;s because there are natural life transitions happening like having a baby, and other times you&rsquo;re just needing a nudge to get back there. This game can be that nudge for your marriage!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/an-affair-is-an-extremely-stupid-idea/ class="link black dim">An Affair is an Extremely Stupid Idea</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">You may not have needed me to tell you that but there are 39 million people in the world and I&rsquo;m sure millions more, who needed to be told that this week.

There have been some interesting findings that have come from a blog post I wrote a few months ago, and I would like to share those with you.
A few months back, I wrote my long-held opinion on bikinis, in the post: &ldquo;Save it For Your Husband.&rdquo; I suggest reading it if you haven&rsquo;t yet, as it can shed some more light on this current post.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/save-it-for-your-husband/ class="link black dim">Save It For Your Husband</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Feel free to LISTEN to this blog post below!

I don&rsquo;t like bikinis, I don&rsquo;t wear them. I think they are immodest and inappropriate and impractical to be wearing swimming. I have read a few articles the past month, that have lead me to feel strongly about sharing why I feel this way about bikinis. One of those articles was, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not celebrating bikini season this year&rdquo; by Kit Steinkellner.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/pornography-a-huge-threat-to-marriage/ class="link black dim">Pornography: A Huge Threat To Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Pornography is one of the biggest threats to marriages and families.

 68% of the divorces involved one party meeting a new lover over the Internet.  56% involved one party having &ldquo;an obsessive interest in pornographic websites.&rdquo; These statistics are disgusting and sad.</div></div></div></div></section></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.github.io>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
