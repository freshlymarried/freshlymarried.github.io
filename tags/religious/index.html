We feel absolutely blessed that we get two babies as a result of our hard work with the Utah Fertility Center. We did 3 timed intercourse cycles that required more and more pills and shots each time, but lead us to our first try at Intrauterine Insemination (IUI).</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/decision-making-the-three-legged-race-in-marriage/ class="link black dim">Decision-Making: The Three-Legged Race in Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The learning curve I think one of the biggest learning curves of newlyweds is decision-making. Of course, you had to make decisions before when you were dating and engaged, but it can be different because the stakes are different. And I think when a person is so smitten with someone, they are more likely to bend to the other person, haha.
The biggest difference when it comes to decision making in marriage is that you now have so many things you&rsquo;re making decisions about, all involving and affecting the other person.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-48/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 48</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I have about 4 more of these blog posts left of this #ajoyfulmarriage project, and I realized I haven&rsquo;t shared about a major aspect of our marriage that brings us so much joy! It&rsquo;s one that initially, I felt sad I hadn&rsquo;t mentioned yet, but realized that this time of year brings it out even more, so it worked out saving it until now :)
Our spirituality brings us me so much joy in our marriage, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure my husband feels joy from it too.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/tips-for-turning-your-house-into-a-home/ class="link black dim">Tips For Turning Your House Into a HOME</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We have been in our house for almost 3 years, this August! It’s awesome to think back on how far we have come with putting it together, and making it feel like HOME.
I recently made an accomplishment with our house that I’m quite proud of &ndash; I FINALLY finished decorating and furnishing our home! This event has made me think about the home furnishing and decorating process, what I liked that I did, and what I would do differently.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/pray-together-stay-together/ class="link black dim">Pray Together, Stay Together</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This is a common catchphrase in religions, even though it might not be a guarantee. While I believe praying is a powerful tool in marriage, it doesn&rsquo;t necessarily guarantee a couple won&rsquo;t get divorced. However, it does pull a large weight when it comes to feeling high marital quality.
I came across a recent article not too long ago from the Institute of Family Studies about how influential religion is in a couple&rsquo;s marital satisfaction.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-future-is-as-bright-as-your-faith/ class="link black dim">The Future is as Bright as Your Faith</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Three years ago I wrote this message to Trevor on the back of a picture quote as encouragement that we could do the long distance thing. (I&rsquo;m sad we can&rsquo;t find the original right now but glad I took a picture of the smeared message I wrote him!) The story behind this little message set a precedent for our relationship and it&rsquo;s one I think every couple needs reminding of :)</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/religion-doesnt-guarantee-your-marriage/ class="link black dim">Religion Doesn't Guarantee A Lasting Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I was married in a Latter-Day Saint temple, where we believe allows your marriage to be eternal. However, simply having my marriage ceremony within my religion doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;m guaranteed to have a happy and healthy marriage! Believing you&rsquo;ll have a forever marriage is different from actually creating one.
Principles to follow I firmly know that the principles taught in my Latter-Day Saint faith and many other faiths directly coincide with principles you should follow for a strong and happy marriage.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/christlike-attributes-and-my-marriage/ class="link black dim">Christlike Attributes and My Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I am religious and rely on God and his son, Jesus Christ, in nearly all aspects of my marriage. So I have been wanting to write about how religion influences my marriage. This week as I have been thinking about Easter and Jesus Christ&rsquo;s Atonement, I have been focused on his actions from his time walking among us on earth: the examples he set of kindness, righteousness, and love. These qualities he displayed have become known as &ldquo;Christlike attributes&rdquo; and although there are many attributes that I could apply in my life, there are a few specifically that have been most applicable to my marriage that I wanted to point out.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/stoplight-kisses/ class="link black dim">Stoplight Kisses</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We used to have a cute little tradition that we started when we were dating called, &ldquo;Stoplight Kisses.&rdquo; When we would drive together and approach a long stoplight, we would lean over and kiss each other :) Sometimes they were hurried kisses, and sometimes one of us kept our eyes open in case the light turned green, haha. But we enjoyed these little moments. Any excuse to kiss right?!
Over the past three years, I&rsquo;m sorry to say we haven&rsquo;t kept up with that tradition!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/same-sex-marriage-doesnt-change-my-traditional-marriage/ class="link black dim">Same-sex Marriage Doesn't Change My Traditional Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Marriage has gone down in history this week with the legalization of same-sex marriages throughout the nation. The past few days I&rsquo;ve been thinking about two things: 1) We are all human and we all have rights, despite our sexual orientation or religious beliefs. 2) How this is an opportune moment for us to increase our appreciation for marriage in general (traditional or non-traditional).
Recognizing the responsibilities Marriage is a big deal to me.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/sitting-waiting-wishing/ class="link black dim">Sitting, Waiting, Wishing</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The word, &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; has been on my mind a lot lately: &ldquo;Is this to-do list realistic?&rdquo; &ldquo;Are my wants realistic right now?&rdquo; &ldquo;Seriously, is this person&rsquo;s life realistic?&rdquo; These are just a few. I&rsquo;ve had a realization that we need to be more honest and appear more realistic as a society, because that&rsquo;s how people relate to each other.

It’s fine. My husband slyly pulled it off after I sat back down.
Well, the time came, sooner than I had expected, that we were asked to speak in Sacrament meeting. To many of you, this may surprise you, but we actually enjoyed it.</div></div></div></div></section></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.com>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
