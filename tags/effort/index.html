Have you ever thought about creativity in your relationship? Hearing that might have some of you thinking, “Uh-oh… I’m not artsy or crafty whatsoever!

However you like to do your goals, whether by choosing a specific word to inspire you, a vision board, or simply writing down the goal in a sentence, make sure you are considering how you can strengthen your marriage.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/5-tips-for-handling-finances-better-in-marriage/ class="link black dim">5 Tips for Handling Finances Better in Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When I originally wrote this draft blog post about 4 years ago, I mentioned that our way of doing things with our finances has been very successful for us, and that we didn&rsquo;t have issues between us due to finances&mldr; WELL, then we bought a house, and cars, and started investing in retirement, got fun medical bills, doing our own side businesses, etc. So our finances got a little more complex, and therefore the responsibilities of managing them got a little bit more intense.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/50-gift-ideas-for-your-spouse/ class="link black dim">50 Gift Ideas for Your Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Every birthday, Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and wedding anniversary, I find myself googling thoughtful gift ideas that I can buy or make for my spouse. The same thing happens when I want to get a “just because” gift for him, or create a special date night for us. Add these up and we’ve got AT LEAST 5 times throughout the year searching for gift ideas.
Over the past few years, I have been keeping track of some awesome finds that interest me or my spouse, and I think most spouses would love too.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/dont-be-intimidated-4-misunderstandings-about-relationship-education/ class="link black dim">Don't Be Intimidated: 4 Misunderstandings About Relationship Education</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Most people don&rsquo;t know the underlying reason for Freshly Married being here. It&rsquo;s because relationship education is important! And yet so many people have either never heard of it before, are intimidated by it, scared of it, or assume it means you have relationship problems you need help with. WELL NEWSFLASH, WE ALL HAVE PROBLEMS! haha. But really.
Because I believe passionately that relationship education is a helpful tool for all relationships, not just marriage, I want to explain what relationship education is while addressing some misunderstandings so that you can feel more comfortable with seeking help.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-51-final-thoughts/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 51 (Final Thoughts)</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">If you&rsquo;ve been following along this past year, every week I&rsquo;ve been writing a blog post each week specifically about a joy that I have found in my marriage that week. Well, that project is now done with, and I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ve ever been as consistent with a project like this before, especially one that is every week for a whole year! You can read here why I started this project in the first place.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-38/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 38</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The Joy I found in my marriage this week is simply little surprises that mean so much!
This joy kind of spans over the past two weeks when my husband gifted me with a massage! I really needed it and they are just my weakness. My body needs it. My mind needs it. So this was a gift I was eager to use.
The other &ldquo;gift&rdquo; was a computer monitor for my office.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/when-you-view-your-spouse-as-an-obstacle/ class="link black dim">When You View Your Spouse as an Obstacle</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Recently, someone in church said something that completely resonated with me in so many ways, and I instantly started writing a bunch of thoughts on it that I had. I want to share those with you!
She talked about how we sometimes look at people as obstacles, and how doing so gives us such a negative attitude and perspective on our situations with them. Hearing that really hit me and I think it’s because of the context it was in&ndash;relating obstacles to people, especially the people whom we have close relationships with.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/elevate-your-date-nights/ class="link black dim">Elevate Your Date Nights</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;ve written a lot about date nights: giving ideas, stressing how important it is, but that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be epic. Well since &ldquo;date night&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t as simple as you think, I&rsquo;ve got more to say about it, of course!
I&rsquo;ve been watching cooking shows lately, and have heard the term &ldquo;elevate&rdquo; be used a lot. It&rsquo;s described as like adding an extra element or level to your dish that gives it a kick to stand out from the typical version of that dish.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/spotlight-making-marriage-a-priority-through-challenging-times/ class="link black dim">Spotlight: Making Marriage a Priority Through Challenging Times</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Introduction: Amberly of A Prioritized Marriage, is someone I absolutely look up to when it comes to marriage!

She gives great responses that not only demonstrate her important message of making the relationship with your spouse a priority, but she shares specific actions on how to do that.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-taking-turns/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: Taking Turns</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This is the beauty of marriage right here. I remember being single not having a consistent person to rely on. Yes, I had loving family and friends but they also have their own lives and their own problems. In marriage, though, your spouse becomes your number one priority and so you get to experience that loving feeling of being taken care of.
There are days where I feel bad that my husband has to deal with my bad days whether I&rsquo;m either emotionally down in the dumps, or just not feeling well physically.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/3-ways-couples-therapy-can-empower-marriage-even-before-the-first-session/ class="link black dim">3 Ways Couples Therapy Can Empower Marriage, Even Before The First Session</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">One day I was flipping through an article on long-lasting celebrity couples, and each couple said something that has helped them be successful in their marriage. Some of the reasons were good, but this one by actor Bryan Cranston (from TV shows Malcolm in the Middle, and Breaking Bad) and his wife of 27 years stuck out to me.
Whether or not couples therapy is successful for them (it seems like it is since they are still married), this statement is so powerful!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/9-misconceptions-about-therapy/ class="link black dim">9 Misconceptions About Therapy</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">To say there are so many stereotypes and stigmas out there associated with therapists and therapy is an understatement. Therapists are often portrayed in movies and TV shows as jokes, and I&rsquo;m not sure why, because seeking help for your mental and emotional state of mind is not a casual or comical thing! It&rsquo;s also just as important to keep yourself emotionally healthy as it is to keep yourself physically healthy!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/seeing-a-therapist-my-own-experiences/ class="link black dim">Seeing a Therapist: My Own Experiences</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I am sharing my experiences because I believe that the more positively we talk about therapy, the less stigma attached to it, and the more likely people are to seek help and actually get the help they need. I have seen a therapist at two different times in my life, and each time was for emotionally difficult situations. I ask for your sensitivity as I get very vulnerable here!
(Just to preface this, I&rsquo;ll refer to both counseling and therapy as one sometimes, just so it&rsquo;s more simple to read, but the two professions are slightly different.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-key-to-finding-your-romantic-spark-again/ class="link black dim">The Key to Finding Your Romantic Spark Again</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I love playing with sparklers in the summer! They are a fun burst of energy and warmth, and have totally &ldquo;sparked&rdquo; a comparison for me to marriage!
Some couples at various points in their marriage, lose those fun, romantic sparks. Sadly, some of these couples wait around for the sparks to come back again on their own, which rarely happens. I think they wait around because it seems like a daunting task, right?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/my-2017-marriage-goals/ class="link black dim">My 2017 Marriage Goal(s)</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">First of all, Happy New Year!!! We are on a Caribbean cruise ringing in the new year, so it&rsquo;s a little belated from me! That&rsquo;s also the reason why we just barely did our annual dinner date night where we share and discuss our goals for the year together. We typically do it on New Year&rsquo;s Eve but we felt like saving it until we got home from our trip. Especially because this fun stuff was going on!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/be-joyful/ class="link black dim">Be Joyful</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Since this is our 3rd attempt at Christmas cards, I kinda feel like I got it right.

When people say that marriage is &ldquo;hard work&rdquo; (which it is!), it&rsquo;s important to explain what kind of work that means so newlyweds don&rsquo;t think exhaustion and stress is all they are getting into!
I think it&rsquo;s hard work because it&rsquo;s a commitment that you&rsquo;ve never encountered before.
Our friends mean so much to all of us.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/stop-and-listen/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays: Stop And Listen</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When life gets busy, it&rsquo;s easy to just keep going and going, working at that to-do list.

For those of you wondering what the word &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; has to do with my overall marriage message, you can read more here :) But using a quick example: when restaurants have items specifically made fresh that day and not days earlier, that&rsquo;s a restaurant you want to eat at, right?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/depression-in-marriage-how-your-depression-affects-your-spouse/ class="link black dim">Depression in Marriage: How Your Depression Affects Your Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;276708040&rdquo; ]
It&rsquo;s not easy being a spouse to someone who suffers from a depression disorder or anxiety disorder. There&rsquo;s much patience required and it might be harder to understand if you have never experienced it before. Some spouses go into marriage with someone who suffers from depression not knowing how much of a mental and physical toll it can also have on themselves. And sadly, many couples go into marriage thinking that because they are so in love with their soulmate, their depression is gone.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/depression-in-marriage-how-your-spouse-affects-your-depression/ class="link black dim">Depression in Marriage: How Your Spouse Affects Your Depression</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;276707574&rdquo; ]
I love this quote. This reflects what my husband has done for me and I feel nothing but overwhelming gratitude when I think about it. Spouses hold an amazing power to love you through your mistakes and weaknesses. They may be the only people close enough, and willing to understand those mistakes and weaknesses. It&rsquo;s such a vulnerable thing, and for them to still stand by your side and come out loving you MORE is just amazing.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/depression-in-your-marriage-the-dos-and-donts/ class="link black dim">Depression in Your Marriage: The Do's and Don'ts</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;276706899&rdquo; ]
It seems more people have been coming out and sharing that they suffer from depression and/or anxiety. Whether it&rsquo;s just during postpartum or a life-long struggle, it&rsquo;s not easy to battle, and not easy to share with everyone that you are among them. I&rsquo;m grateful that more people are sharing this because it is not uncommon. We all experience hard and even traumatic things, and sometimes the explanation is just that the brain chemicals are imbalanced which causes the bouts of depression.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-power-of-empathy/ class="link black dim">The Power of Empathy</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">“The truth is, Rarely can a response make something better.

The idea of growing apart happens gradually over time.

Think about that as you answer the #freshfridays question: &ldquo;What change can you make TODAY to freshen up your marriage?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/great-marriages-are-built/ class="link black dim">Great Marriages Are Built Brick by Brick</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">&ldquo;&mldr;That is good news because no matter how flat your relationship may be at present, if you keep adding pebbles of kindness, compassion, listening, sacrifice, understanding, and selflessness, eventually a mighty pyramid will begin to grow.&rdquo; This weekend I watched Latter-Day Saint General Conference and heard some great spiritual messages!

Because I&rsquo;m in this same grouping, it gives me mixed feelings, realizing that divorce truly is a possibility, but that I&rsquo;m glad I have the strong marriage I have.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-what-will-you-do-now-to-keep-your-marriage-fresh/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays: What Will You do Now to Keep Your Marriage Fresh?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">There&rsquo;s no time like the present!

I now want to discuss another aspect of social media that can affect our marriages.
THINK ABOUT YOUR SOCIAL CONNECTIONS I didn&rsquo;t think there was a problem having tons of friends when I first started facebook back in high school. It was neat to be able to connect, but then I realized how it can make me feel envious or inadequate when I spend a lot of time on it and am involved in other people&rsquo;s lives so much.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-what-will-you-do-this-weekend-to-keep-your-marriage-fresh/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays: What Will You do This Weekend to Keep Your Marriage Fresh?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;ve been down lately about some things and I&rsquo;m realizing that I feel a little better when I do little things for my husband.

I really think there&rsquo;s an awesome power that comes with love notes. Having a physical copy of how your spouse feels about you is something you can refer to in years to come, which makes it more special. Trevor and I used to write more to each other while we were dating, and I think it&rsquo;s because we lived an hour away from each other.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-door-handle-trick/ class="link black dim">The Door Handle Trick</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">In a presentation about having a more connected marriage, one of my UVU professors shared this cute story about something he does in his marriage and I thought it was inspiring to share!

I think that by ending your night with a kiss sets you up for good feelings before you go to sleep. Good feelings or bad feelings can be the difference between staying up all night or having a beautiful sleep!
Don&rsquo;t get me wrong here, I&rsquo;m not saying that if you don&rsquo;t kiss your spouse goodnight that you are a terrible spouse, or that you&rsquo;ll have bad feelings before you fall asleep!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-what-will-you-do-this-valentines-day-to-keep-your-marriage-fresh/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays: What Will You do This Valentine's Day to Keep Your Marriage Fresh?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">My #freshfridays question is to help those of us who haven&rsquo;t planned out their Valentine&rsquo;s Day yet ;) (me being one of them!)

For the past four or five months on our dates we have been trying to better focus our conversations on ourselves, rather than work, school, and other business.

Since they moved in, almost every day we heard them yelling. The parents would yell at each other, the parents yelled at the kids, and the kids yelled at the parents. I absolutely hated it; I cringed every time. Yes, I cringed because it is annoying, but mainly because it shows that they are were not loving each other and instead were hurting each other.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/hug-more-kiss-more/ class="link black dim">Hug More, Kiss More</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">HUG MORE.

So many people right now are thinking about how they can better themselves for the new year. I am doing that right now, too! But one area people tend to forget to make a resolution for is in their relationships. Do I need to mention how awesome and important that is to do in your MARRIAGE?!

Husbands complaining and saying comments like, “this is torture” when helping their wife plan a party or something only she is really interested in doing. They say sarcastic things under their breath at each other.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/monday-morning-pick-me-ups/ class="link black dim">Monday Morning Pick-Me-Ups</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m so glad we happened to get a blooper photo of me actually picking my husband up because it worked perfectly for this ;)

On our first date, Trevor and I started talking about some things we like to do, and we found most of them we had in common (of course!) Since he had recently come home from serving an Latter-Day Saint mission, I started suggesting some of the movies he should watch and music to listen to that came out while he was gone. It started as that, and then somehow it turned into things that we were possibly going to do together&mldr; :) So being the list people that we are, Trevor pulled out his phone and created a google doc, listing these things to do.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/putting-your-spouse-before-children/ class="link black dim">Prioritizing My Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I used to be one of those people that thought you should do anything and everything for your kids - that they should be the priority. It&rsquo;s portrayed in movies of parents willing to do anything for their kids. Overtime this philosophy has changed for me, especially since finding Trevor.

How social media has affected my marriage Trevor and I differ on our level of social interaction.

All the world&rsquo;s a stage I think each of us are on a stage. We give a public presentation of ourselves to an audience &ndash; the people walking by us on the streets, our co-workers, friends, family, and our virtual friends on social media. When we go out on stage, we pick the parts of ourselves that we want people to see.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/my-struggle-with-social-media-part-1/ class="link black dim">My Struggle With Social Media: Part 1</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">From about September to December, I really struggled emotionally with social media. I fell into some common pitfalls of comparing my life to other people&rsquo;s lives, questioning how &ldquo;real&rdquo; people were, and spending more time being involved in it than I should have (though I wouldn&rsquo;t say I was addicted). These things were lowering my self-worth, and making me feel ungrateful. I snapped out of this phase and realized some important things that have made me and my marriage happier.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/grocery-budgeting/ class="link black dim">Grocery Budgeting</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Wanna know something funny?

I look through the coupons we get in the mail to see if there&rsquo;s a deal on something we actually use or eat, I&rsquo;ll take advantage of good sales going on and stock up in bulk (one of the big suggestions to saving money on groceries), and I&rsquo;ll avoid getting items sometimes that I think are too expensive that week.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/loving-at-arms-length/ class="link black dim">Loving at Arms-Length</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I attended a women&rsquo;s conference with my mom a few weeks ago and I was inspired by one of the speakers who talked about &ldquo;loving at arms-length.&rdquo; It was actually Dawn Armstrong, the mother of the missionary from the movie, &ldquo;Meet the Mormons.&rdquo; She talked about how she has a lot of love for so many people; sometimes people who randomly come along.

Back in college I had to do an assignment relating marriage and relationships to something. It could be an object or an action, we just had to explain why. I found a lot of similarities between hiking and marriage so I wrote all those down here for you! :)
It&rsquo;s a crazy, fun, stressful, scary, beautiful adventure together.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/newlywed-weight-gain/ class="link black dim">Newlywed Weight Gain</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Did any other couples gain weight their first months of year of marriage?

On a daily basis I find myself learning something neat about normal family functioning, and how to handle relationships. And of course, when I&rsquo;m learning all of it, I think of the various relationships I have that apply to that idea, and it helps me understand and remember the concept better.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-honeymoon-phase/ class="link black dim">The Honeymoon phase</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When you think about a typical honeymoon (or look back on your own honeymoon), it&rsquo;s a pretty great experience :) This picture is of us on our honeymoon to Park City; a.k.a Our best vacation ever!
