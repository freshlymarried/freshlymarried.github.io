Some people are affected with loss of loved ones or even just the loss of a social life.

People have been asking how I am doing since I have been absent from posting much on the Freshly Married website and social media. And to answer everyone, I am doing GREAT! Some days are anxiety-ridden and November to mid-December we’re pretty tiring ( #sleepregression ).

The idea of sharing your hopes and dreams as individuals and as a couple is so meaningful to a relationship! There are so many positives it brings to your life because it’s a very hopeful concept.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/tabletalk-savory-dinner-conversations-for-two/ class="link black dim">#TableTalk -- Savory Dinner Conversations for Two</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">***This article contains affiliate links so if you purchase, I make a small percentage of that.
How many times do we eat dinner together at home in front of the television, without saying much to each other? We are pretty good at having conversations, but I can&rsquo;t count how many times we&rsquo;ve still done this. :) It&rsquo;s easy to do when we just have the two of us, and we just want to escape from the tasks and stress of the day.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/50-gift-ideas-for-your-spouse/ class="link black dim">50 Gift Ideas for Your Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Every birthday, Christmas, Valentine’s Day, and wedding anniversary, I find myself googling thoughtful gift ideas that I can buy or make for my spouse. The same thing happens when I want to get a “just because” gift for him, or create a special date night for us. Add these up and we’ve got AT LEAST 5 times throughout the year searching for gift ideas.
Over the past few years, I have been keeping track of some awesome finds that interest me or my spouse, and I think most spouses would love too.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/unboxing-video-blind-date-from-date-night-in/ class="link black dim">Unboxing Video: "Blind Date" from Date Night In</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Date boxes have been a new thing the past few years, and I think are recently gaining more traction for couples, especially those with busy lives. Last year my husband and I experimented with date boxes to see what they are all about, and to see if they would give us added fun in our marriage :)
I wrote an article on how date boxes work, so if you&rsquo;re not familiar with the concept, check that out.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-44/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 44</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I like to think my DIY skills and creativity bless our marriage for the better :) If we’re talking about it bringing joy to my marriage, it sure does because I fully enjoy doing little thoughtful surprises/projects like this one I did for hubby this week.
We have this thing called “ultimate couch bed” that we like to do periodically throughout the year. Particularly when there are some movie marathons of tv show binge watching or someone is sick and we know we will be on the couch all weekend :) It&rsquo;s where we rearrange our couch sectional pieces in the living room to form one giant couch right in front of the TV.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/elevate-your-date-nights/ class="link black dim">Elevate Your Date Nights</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;ve written a lot about date nights: giving ideas, stressing how important it is, but that it doesn&rsquo;t have to be epic. Well since &ldquo;date night&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t as simple as you think, I&rsquo;ve got more to say about it, of course!
I&rsquo;ve been watching cooking shows lately, and have heard the term &ldquo;elevate&rdquo; be used a lot. It&rsquo;s described as like adding an extra element or level to your dish that gives it a kick to stand out from the typical version of that dish.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-25/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 25</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m almost half way through this project to live a more joyful marriage! It&rsquo;s been such a good exercise for me to do each week because sometimes I have to think a little harder about the joys in life and in marriage. And that has helped me see things deeper in our relationship.
There have been a few things in our marriage this week that has brought me joy! :) But one main thing that I have found joy in this week was in our ultimate cereal date night on Friday!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/crated-with-love-date-box-review/ class="link black dim">Crated With Love - Date Box Review</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">My husband and I tried out different date boxes to give you an idea of what each one offers!

Talking too much business stuff - the kids’ schedules, work stress, etc. Not knowing what to talk about, especially if you think you know everything about each other already Bringing up issues that start an argument I think we’ve all found ourselves in one of these situations on our date nights before.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/same-old-dates/ class="link black dim">Same Old Dates</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">THE SPECIAL OCCASION PRESSURES The night before Valentine&rsquo;s Day, we were talking about our holiday plans and my husband voiced to me that he has spent hours over the past few weeks trying to figure out a special activity for us to do for Valentine&rsquo;s Day that wasn&rsquo;t something we had already done or that feels &ldquo;same ole, same ole&rdquo; like going to the movies.

Some couples at various points in their marriage, lose those fun, romantic sparks. Sadly, some of these couples wait around for the sparks to come back again on their own, which rarely happens.

On a weekend, recently, I was looking at the Instagram stories in my feed and one came up that bothered me. Someone snapped (I guess that&rsquo;s a word now) their entire date night on both Instagram and Snapchat. I don&rsquo;t have Snapchat, but I know this because the captions on Instagram were encouraging followers to also go over there to watch other parts from their date.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/date-night-pressures/ class="link black dim">Date Night Pressures</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Everyone knows that I&rsquo;m a big promoter of date night. Especially with my giveaways. I just believe that it&rsquo;s important to have time together alone with your spouse. :) But I don&rsquo;t want to give anyone the idea that your time together has to be epic enough to be given the &ldquo;date night&rdquo; title. Date night shouldn&rsquo;t feel pressured.
All quality time is important! And in some life circumstances, we have to take what we can get, right?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/cafe-rio-date-night-giveaway/ class="link black dim">Cafe Rio Date Night Giveaway</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">***GIVEAWAY CLOSED***
Many of our summer nights lately have consisted of take-out dinner. Somehow it&rsquo;s mostly Mexican food, too, which means Cafe Rio :) We like going to the restaurant itself occasionally but sometimes we are just too pooped from the day, and just want to eat it at home while we watch Monk :) Know what I&rsquo;m saying?! There&rsquo;s been a big question apparently of what the masses prefer: their new Spicy Green Chile Pork, or their classic Sweet Pork.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/instax-mini-camera-giveaway/ class="link black dim">Instax Mini Camera Giveaway</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">***Giveaway closed.*** Winner listed at the bottom of the post *This post contains affiliate links.
This week my focus is on the importance of recording the memories in marriage! I talk about how important it is to journal the little details here, with 10 ideas for how you can do that! I also wrote here about how important it is to update your family photos often AND make sure to hang them up in your house!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/intentional-double-dating/ class="link black dim">Intentional Double Dating</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links.
Our time is very valuable as married couples, individuals, and parents. Weekends seem to be dispersed between your own events and obligations, family events, or just plain staying home on a Saturday night relaxing! If you got kids, throw in their games and activities, too. So when it comes to date night, it&rsquo;s rare for some of us to find time for double dates, let alone our own dates!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-sexy-dice-game/ class="link black dim">The Sexy Dice Game</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m excited to share this idea with you guys because I think it&rsquo;s a fun, EASY way to switch things up when it comes to your sex life!
For whatever reason, we all experience a hiatus of sexual intimacy at times. Sometimes it&rsquo;s because there are natural life transitions happening like having a baby, and other times you&rsquo;re just needing a nudge to get back there. This game can be that nudge for your marriage!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/if-you-havent-been-on-a-date-in-awhile/ class="link black dim">If You Haven't Been On a Date in Awhile...</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">To the couples who haven&rsquo;t gone on a date in awhile:

I really think there&rsquo;s an awesome power that comes with love notes. Having a physical copy of how your spouse feels about you is something you can refer to in years to come, which makes it more special. Trevor and I used to write more to each other while we were dating, and I think it&rsquo;s because we lived an hour away from each other.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-smashing-valentines-day/ class="link black dim">A Smashing Valentine's Day</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This Valentine&rsquo;s Day is going to be a little more low-key for us and we like it that way right now. :) However, low-key doesn&rsquo;t mean we aren&rsquo;t doing anything new or special!

A response that was similar among multiple entries was that they try to keep each other a priority among new situations like having babies. Other responses were back to the simple basics: making dinner together, having weekly date nights, dancing in the kitchen, and other quality time activities :) I just really liked hearing these responses because not only do they inspire my own marriage, but those who saw your posts were also inspired!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/superbowl-50-date-night-giveaway/ class="link black dim">Superbowl $50 Date Night Giveaway</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Do you guys know Stuart Edge?

For the past four or five months on our dates we have been trying to better focus our conversations on ourselves, rather than work, school, and other business. Trevor would think of questions or look up some to ask each other and it was fun.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-date-night-bucket-list/ class="link black dim">The Date Night Bucket List</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links.
On our first date, Trevor and I started talking about some things we like to do, and we found most of them we had in common (of course!) Since he had recently come home from serving an Latter-Day Saint mission, I started suggesting some of the movies he should watch and music to listen to that came out while he was gone. It started as that, and then somehow it turned into things that we were possibly going to do together&mldr; :) So being the list people that we are, Trevor pulled out his phone and created a google doc, listing these things to do.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/relationship-enhancement-workshop/ class="link black dim">Relationship Enhancement Workshop</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m suuuuuper excited to announce that I am now a PREP trained facilitator!

I know it&rsquo;s so much easier for newlyweds to continue to date, and make time for dates, but that&rsquo;s not an excuse to lack!

I know, I act like a twelve-year-old sometimes because I say &ldquo;your face is a _____ &ldquo;(fill in the blank), whenever the opportunity arises, haha.
