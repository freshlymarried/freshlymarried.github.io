class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I was recently reading an old interview with actress Jennifer Garner in Vanity Fair on her marriage to Ben Affleck. As you probably know, they split up after ten years of marriage, sadly. It&rsquo;s something that I can tell she really wanted to work out, especially already having a previous divorce under her belt. She said some very mature and admirable things about their marriage and their divorce, but her overall statement made my heart break with confusion.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/when-you-view-your-spouse-as-an-obstacle/ class="link black dim">When You View Your Spouse as an Obstacle</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Recently, someone in church said something that completely resonated with me in so many ways, and I instantly started writing a bunch of thoughts on it that I had. I want to share those with you!
She talked about how we sometimes look at people as obstacles, and how doing so gives us such a negative attitude and perspective on our situations with them. Hearing that really hit me and I think it’s because of the context it was in&ndash;relating obstacles to people, especially the people whom we have close relationships with.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-12/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 12</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The Joy I found in my marriage this week: the power of a &ldquo;thank you.&rdquo; This week I have been noticing how much we say “Thank you” to each other. Whether it’s something big like bringing home the bacon from work every day, making dinner, or just giving a back scratch. For the whole week, I watched all these back and forth tokens of appreciation change the way we talk to each other, and the way we go about doing things for each other.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/taking-responsibility-for-your-sexuality/ class="link black dim">Taking Responsibility For Your Sexuality</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links.
I think one of the biggest hangups a couple can have when it comes to their sex life is not understanding their own sexuality first. It makes me sad that so many married people don’t even understand this huge part of their life and who they are. Which is like, the basis of a satisfying sex life for both husband and wife!
Why it&rsquo;s important SOOOO I want to talk just a little bit about this.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/#freshfridays-quote-the-six-second-kiss/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: The Six-Second Kiss</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">#freshfridays quote asking &ldquo;Have you had your six-second kiss today?&rdquo;
I don&rsquo;t think we should look at the word &lsquo;potential&rsquo; with an eye-roll, because it doesn&rsquo;t mean a long kiss has to lead to sex. An extra long kiss is just more special than the quick kiss goodbye or quick kiss when getting home from work.
So I think the &lsquo;potential&rsquo; he&rsquo;s referring to is focused more on how that kind of intentional and more meaningful kiss can lead to a more meaningful relationship; more meaningful days together; more meaningful emotional intimacy.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/#freshfridays-quote-taking-turns/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: Taking Turns</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This is the beauty of marriage right here. I remember being single not having a consistent person to rely on. Yes, I had loving family and friends but they also have their own lives and their own problems. In marriage, though, your spouse becomes your number one priority and so you get to experience that loving feeling of being taken care of.
There are days where I feel bad that my husband has to deal with my bad days whether I&rsquo;m either emotionally down in the dumps, or just not feeling well physically.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/3-ways-couples-therapy-can-empower-marriage-even-before-the-first-session/ class="link black dim">3 Ways Couples Therapy Can Empower Marriage, Even Before The First Session</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">One day I was flipping through an article on long-lasting celebrity couples, and each couple said something that has helped them be successful in their marriage. Some of the reasons were good, but this one by actor Bryan Cranston (from TV shows Malcolm in the Middle, and Breaking Bad) and his wife of 27 years stuck out to me.
Whether or not couples therapy is successful for them (it seems like it is since they are still married), this statement is so powerful!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/9-misconceptions-about-therapy/ class="link black dim">9 Misconceptions About Therapy</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">To say there are so many stereotypes and stigmas out there associated with therapists and therapy is an understatement. Therapists are often portrayed in movies and TV shows as jokes, and I&rsquo;m not sure why, because seeking help for your mental and emotional state of mind is not a casual or comical thing! It&rsquo;s also just as important to keep yourself emotionally healthy as it is to keep yourself physically healthy!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/disapproving-parents-how-to-handle-it-and-why-you-should-do-that-now/ class="link black dim">Disapproving Parents: How to Handle it and Why You Should Do That Now</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">My heart hurts every time I hear my friends, neighbors, etc. tell me that their parents still don&rsquo;t approve of their spouse. It&rsquo;s hard to listen to them tell me things like, &ldquo;They think he isn&rsquo;t good enough for me&rdquo; or &ldquo;They tried to break us up.&rdquo; These kinds of family situations frustrate me primarily because HELLO PARENTS, IT&rsquo;S AFTER-THE-FACT! THEY HAVE BEEN MARRIED FOR YEARS NOW, SO PUT ASIDE YOUR OWN FEELINGS AND SUPPORT THEM INSTEAD OF DISCOURAGE THEM!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-key-to-finding-your-romantic-spark-again/ class="link black dim">The Key to Finding Your Romantic Spark Again</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I love playing with sparklers in the summer! They are a fun burst of energy and warmth, and have totally &ldquo;sparked&rdquo; a comparison for me to marriage!
Some couples at various points in their marriage, lose those fun, romantic sparks. Sadly, some of these couples wait around for the sparks to come back again on their own, which rarely happens. I think they wait around because it seems like a daunting task, right?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/be-joyful/ class="link black dim">Be Joyful</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Since this is our 3rd attempt at Christmas cards, I kinda feel like I got it right. Maybe! I didn&rsquo;t feel like I could put together a newsletter super quickly even though I already had our template from last year. Something inside me suggested making it somewhat more simple this year. But I like to give more than just the picture of us with a small Christmas phrase with our names on it.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/#freshfridays-quote-in-the-middle-of-difficulty/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays quote: In The Middle of Difficulty</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll ever stop getting inspired by quotes that remind me to look for the lesson through hard times!
If we apply this to marriage, I think the opportunity that #alberteinstein is talking about here are the opportunities to learn something about yourself, your spouse, or the issue.
If our difficulty is disagreeing on something important, I get the chance to see another perspective I didn&rsquo;t see before. I also get the chance to analyze myself and how I can improve.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/#freshfridays-quote-branches-vs.-roots/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: Branches vs. Roots</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This quote below is great to remember in times of disconnection and conflict. We try to look on their surface for any emotion to provide us with answers, but what&rsquo;s showing on the outside might not be how they actually feel or think.
You may think &ldquo;He looks like he could care less right now!

Which is why I love this #freshfridays quote.
When we make choices based on our fears it&rsquo;s coming from a place of doubt. But when we make choices based on our hopes, it&rsquo;s coming from a place of faith. Total opposites that can greatly change an attitude and even an outcome, right?
I&rsquo;ve been working on changing this way of thinking for myself lately.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/touch-toes/ class="link black dim">Touch Toes</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Actor Chris Pratt just did and said some things about marriage and family that are too good not to share!

TWO THINGS I LOVE ABOUT THIS: I love seeing couples make sacrifices for their marriage and family, whether small or large.

This question is so important to the #freshlymarried perspective! I believe that our daily positive actions add up to create a strong marriage, and asking ourselves this question can help us do that.
For those of you wondering what the word &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; has to do with my overall marriage message, you can read more here :) But using a quick example: when restaurants have items specifically made fresh that day and not days earlier, that&rsquo;s a restaurant you want to eat at, right?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/#freshfridays-quote-i-have-a-choice/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: I Have a Choice</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I want to gear this #freshfridays quote towards our emotions. No one is in control of our emotions except for ourselves. So when we react terribly towards something our spouse says or does, we have to own that. That’s why I love this quote, reminding me that I get to choose how I react to a situation, but that my choice is also important.
There&rsquo;s a few types of choices, I believe.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-power-of-empathy/ class="link black dim">The Power of Empathy</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">“The truth is, Rarely can a response make something better.

They say sarcastic things under their breath at each other.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/back-to-basics/ class="link black dim">Back to Basics</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I love Dr. Seuss. And not just because we have the same birthday :) When he says things, it has a way of making you think differently. My perspectives change and sometimes it results with a smack to the forehead like I should have known it all along, haha. Well this quote is one of those moments for me.
Appearances can be deceiving A lot of times we look at a complex question and think that finding the answer is also complex.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/monday-morning-pick-me-ups/ class="link black dim">Monday Morning Pick-Me-Ups</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m so glad we happened to get a blooper photo of me actually picking my husband up because it worked perfectly for this ;)
Mondays can be hard, huh? It&rsquo;s beginning another week of the daily grind, wishing you could go back to Friday :) What helps us get by on these days where we are lagging? Sometimes it&rsquo;s a funny video on youtube. Other times it&rsquo;s a diet coke or brownie.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-power-of-kindness/ class="link black dim">The Power of Kindness</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We all know that being kind can change someone&rsquo;s entire day around, or maybe someone&rsquo;s act of kindness has changed YOUR entire day. Kindness is so powerful, if you didn&rsquo;t know that already! Throughout my marriage I&rsquo;ve definitely been shown and taught how powerful it can be.
When Trevor and I first experienced tiffs with each other, our process of being upset and also working through it was something new to me.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-grass-is-green-where-you-water-it/ class="link black dim">The Grass is Green Where You Water it</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I love love love this thought because it&rsquo;s a great reminder to me that it takes an effort to make things great, and even when it&rsquo;s achieved, it has to be maintained! It also attacks that old saying: &ldquo;The grass is greener on the other side,&rdquo; and I have a few ways I like to relate this to marriage&mldr;
It&rsquo;s easy to look at all the other marriages around you and wish your relationship could be as wonderful as there&rsquo;s.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/complete-rather-than-compete/ class="link black dim">Complete Rather Than Compete</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;m excited to say that this guy is starting a new job at DOMO tomorrow and I&rsquo;m pretty proud of him! Getting this job is kind of a bittersweet story for us, and I want to share it because I think it&rsquo;s something every marriage will face on some level.
&ldquo;There is so much more of happiness to be had when we can rejoice in another&rsquo;s successes and not just in our own.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-little-victories/ class="link black dim">The Little Victories</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I have been thinking about the little milestones in marriage a lot lately. The anniversaries and growing families are great &ndash; super awesome milestones! But I think it&rsquo;s nice to honor those little things we do in marriage&mldr; The &ldquo;little victories&rdquo; if you will!
The little victory I had when I wrote this was making a meal I have never made before, and slam dunkin&rsquo; the &ldquo;HONEY THIS TASTES SO GOOD!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/you-are-my-happy/ class="link black dim">You Are My Happy</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Found this quote the other day and I really liked it. Yeah it&rsquo;s cheesy and cutesy, as well as simple and thought-provoking.
Bittersweet decisions Throughout the past years I&rsquo;ve come to know what&rsquo;s most important in life. (Maybe it&rsquo;s the selflessness I had to learn going into marriage, or maybe it&rsquo;s just maturity? haha) It&rsquo;s a bittersweet answer for me when I ask myself questions about the things I&rsquo;m currently doing in my life.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/my-struggle-with-social-media-part-3/ class="link black dim">My Struggle With Social Media: Part 3</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This is the last post in a series of three posts on this subject.

How social media has affected my marriage Trevor and I differ on our level of social interaction.

All the world&rsquo;s a stage I think each of us are on a stage. We give a public presentation of ourselves to an audience &ndash; the people walking by us on the streets, our co-workers, friends, family, and our virtual friends on social media. When we go out on stage, we pick the parts of ourselves that we want people to see.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/marriage-is-like-a-hiking-trip/ class="link black dim">Marriage is like a hiking trip</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Click the play button to LISTEN to this blog post!

Back in college I had to do an assignment relating marriage and relationships to something. It could be an object or an action, we just had to explain why. I found a lot of similarities between hiking and marriage so I wrote all those down here for you! :)
It&rsquo;s a crazy, fun, stressful, scary, beautiful adventure together.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/i-know-how-the-river-feels/ class="link black dim">I Know How The River Feels</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I found this quote a long time ago, and it has been my favorite ever since. Unfortunately, I don&rsquo;t like the song that these words come from, haha. I will credit the band and the song though anyways.

As a young adult, there were so many directions to go, and many crucial life decisions coming at me.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/scissors-and-glue/ class="link black dim">Scissors and Glue</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">For more than 11 years I have kept a quote book, where I have written down any intuitive thoughts, quotes, lyrics, speeches, movie lines, or any other words that I have found meaningful.

I love my wife. I am very thankful for the nice little notes that she leaves me around our apartment, on our bathroom mirror, on the fridge, through text messages, and through voicemails.</div></div></div></div></section></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.github.io>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
