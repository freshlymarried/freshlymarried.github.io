What’s a “White Elephant” gift? It’s a silly gag gift usually for playing a White Elephant game!
How does it work? There&rsquo;s a pile of gifts, one per person who is playing. Everyone draws a number which decides the order they choose a gift from the pile. If you have 13 people/13 gifts, you’ll have numbers 1-13 to draw from. Starting with person #1, they will choose a gift from the pile to unwrap and reveal to everyone.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/5-tips-for-handling-finances-better-in-marriage/ class="link black dim">5 Tips for Handling Finances Better in Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">When I originally wrote this draft blog post about 4 years ago, I mentioned that our way of doing things with our finances has been very successful for us, and that we didn&rsquo;t have issues between us due to finances&mldr; WELL, then we bought a house, and cars, and started investing in retirement, got fun medical bills, doing our own side businesses, etc. So our finances got a little more complex, and therefore the responsibilities of managing them got a little bit more intense.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/tabletalk-savory-dinner-conversations-for-two/ class="link black dim">#TableTalk -- Savory Dinner Conversations for Two</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">***This article contains affiliate links so if you purchase, I make a small percentage of that.

She talks about how as humans we have two fundamental human needs that conflict with each other when we are in a committed relationship.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/unboxing-video-blind-date-from-date-night-in/ class="link black dim">Unboxing Video: "Blind Date" from Date Night In</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Date boxes have been a new thing the past few years, and I think are recently gaining more traction for couples, especially those with busy lives.

I wrote an article on how date boxes work, so if you&rsquo;re not familiar with the concept, check that out.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/prize-contest-celebrating-video-course/ class="link black dim">Prize Contest Celebrating Video Course!</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The day before I came down with a nasty influenza I announced my video course: “How to Navigate Your Differences.” I also said that to celebrate I was going to do an awesome giveaway prize, and then… well the flu.

I just want to say that I have been so excited about this video course, because it&rsquo;s so applicable for ALL marriages, no matter what stage you are in, or how deep your problems are!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/wife-life-workshop-recap-january-20-2018/ class="link black dim">Wife Life Workshop Recap - January 20, 2018</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The Wife Life Workshop was held on Saturday afternoon, January 20, 2018, at the Miller Conference Center in Sandy, Utah. More than 40 wives came together to be uplifted and enriched in the many hats they wear as a wife!
I wanted to give a little glimpse into what these workshops are like! Every workshop will cover different topics, and is a new experience!

Of course, you had to make decisions before when you were dating and engaged, but it can be different because the stakes are different. And I think when a person is so smitten with someone, they are more likely to bend to the other person, haha.
The biggest difference when it comes to decision making in marriage is that you now have so many things you&rsquo;re making decisions about, all involving and affecting the other person.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/dont-be-intimidated-4-misunderstandings-about-relationship-education/ class="link black dim">Don't Be Intimidated: 4 Misunderstandings About Relationship Education</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Most people don&rsquo;t know the underlying reason for Freshly Married being here.

And yet so many people have either never heard of it before, are intimidated by it, scared of it, or assume it means you have relationship problems you need help with. WELL NEWSFLASH, WE ALL HAVE PROBLEMS! haha. But really.
Because I believe passionately that relationship education is a helpful tool for all relationships, not just marriage, I want to explain what relationship education is while addressing some misunderstandings so that you can feel more comfortable with seeking help.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-51-final-thoughts/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 51 (Final Thoughts)</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">If you&rsquo;ve been following along this past year, every week I&rsquo;ve been writing a blog post each week specifically about a joy that I have found in my marriage that week.

Next week&rsquo;s joy will be sharing my overall thoughts of this project, so look forward to that!
The joy I found in my marriage this week is how we are goal-oriented and encourage growth in each other. One of the ways that we did this is through sharing goals with each other for the new year.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-49/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 49</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We have been feeling some joy this past week and I&rsquo;m not quite sure how to sum it up into one word, but I think it could be summarized into patience and clarity.
Patience usually is not a joyous word, haha, but it is when you have achieved patience, right? Well this weekend we got a new car! It&rsquo;s one I&rsquo;ve been eyeing for awhile now and even test-drove it over a year ago.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-48/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 48</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I have about 4 more of these blog posts left of this #ajoyfulmarriage project, and I realized I haven&rsquo;t shared about a major aspect of our marriage that brings us so much joy! It&rsquo;s one that initially, I felt sad I hadn&rsquo;t mentioned yet, but realized that this time of year brings it out even more, so it worked out saving it until now :)
Our spirituality brings us me so much joy in our marriage, and I&rsquo;m pretty sure my husband feels joy from it too.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-47/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 47</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Something I believe both my husband and I find joy in for our marriage, is going out to eat &mdash; enjoying quality-made meals and trying new foods.
I know it sounds funny but this is something we care about! I mean, it&rsquo;s something you do 3+ times a day, so it matters, right?! He loves getting the chance to eat food that I don&rsquo;t know how to cook well, and I love the opportunity for someone skilled to make us dinner, haha.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-46/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 46</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A quality in our marriage that brings me joy is our ability to count our blessings.
We are good at that. And I don&rsquo;t mean that in the literal counting sense, as if we are keeping track and pouting if we didn&rsquo;t have as many as we did last month, lol. I just meant that in a way that we can find a positive spin to situations, or find things to be thankful for, even amidst times of trials.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/3-tips-for-preventing-holiday-stress-from-affecting-your-marriage/ class="link black dim">3 Tips For Preventing Holiday Stress From Affecting Your Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We are all well aware that while the holiday season can be a wonderful time of year spent with loved ones, it can also bring with it some stress. Just a few examples: spending hours trying to make your house look festive; thinking of the perfect gifts for family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers, then having to go get those gifts and wrap them, while trying to not spend a fortune; making special food for the celebrations; and feeling pressure to make special memories.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-45/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 45</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Our church offers a Sunday school class on the topic of marriage and family, and the lesson yesterday reminded me of something in our marriage that brings us joy: the value we see in each other. I wanted to share this interesting object lesson the teacher used and why I loved it!
One of the teachers held up a gold dollar coin and said that it represented us being &ldquo;one&rdquo; in our marriage.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-44/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 44</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I like to think my DIY skills and creativity bless our marriage for the better :) If we’re talking about it bringing joy to my marriage, it sure does because I fully enjoy doing little thoughtful surprises/projects like this one I did for hubby this week.
We have this thing called “ultimate couch bed” that we like to do periodically throughout the year. Particularly when there are some movie marathons of tv show binge watching or someone is sick and we know we will be on the couch all weekend :) It&rsquo;s where we rearrange our couch sectional pieces in the living room to form one giant couch right in front of the TV.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-43/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 43</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A characteristic about the both of us that brings me joy in our marriage is that we both are practical thinkers.
This may seem like a boring trait to find joy in but if you are a person who struggles with anxiety and worries over little things, it could cause more anxiety to be with someone who constantly makes irrational decisions on a whim, haha. Since we both can relate to those worrisome feelings, I feel like we can rely on each other in a comforting way.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/important-thoughts-on-success-and-failure-in-marriage/ class="link black dim">Important Thoughts on Success and Failure in Marriage</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I was recently reading an old interview with actress Jennifer Garner in Vanity Fair on her marriage to Ben Affleck. As you probably know, they split up after ten years of marriage, sadly. It&rsquo;s something that I can tell she really wanted to work out, especially already having a previous divorce under her belt. She said some very mature and admirable things about their marriage and their divorce, but her overall statement made my heart break with confusion.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-42/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 42</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">It&rsquo;s getting harder to be vulnerable week to week sharing details about our marriage, but I committed to this project at the beginning of the year, and I know it&rsquo;s helping me train my outlook on marriage for the better!

It&rsquo;s sort of embarrassing to share, but I snore sometimes when I sleep, haha. I&rsquo;m blaming it on all my sinus issues though!

After my husband was reading on how that can be dangerous to not be able to take off our rings, he decided he wanted to get a new ring and I totally understand.
I wasn&rsquo;t planning on it when we got to the jeweler, but we ended up cutting my ring off too and are getting it resized.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-39/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 39</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I&rsquo;ve been recovering from Sinus Surgery #2 the past week, and going into it I didn&rsquo;t think I would have a lot to feel joyous about because the first surgery&rsquo;s recovery was horrible.

A very common complaint among married couples, especially couples that have sexual intimacy problems, is that one spouse seems to want or enjoy sex more than their spouse does.

It&rsquo;s crazy how you can talk about infertility with other people and learn about it, but when it becomes more real for you personally, it becomes this really hard thing to say out loud, or even type.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-31/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 31</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The joy I found in my marriage this week: that feeling when you kiss and make-up.

It sucks when you disappoint each other because you don&rsquo;t agree on something. But it&rsquo;s also a reality of marriage because you are two different people joining your lives together. It still doesn&rsquo;t feel good to hit that low, but man is it good to go back and hit that high :)</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/4-mistakes-we-make-when-a-friends-marriage-is-struggling/ class="link black dim">4 Mistakes We Make When a Friend’s Marriage is Struggling</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">It’s not easy to see your friends go through hard struggles, especially when it comes to such an important relationship like marriage. It’s also not easy to be the confidant, the person they choose to share their marital struggles with.

He&rsquo;s very patient with me on weeks that I fall short, where I complain a lot, and don&rsquo;t do the usual things that I do. And yet he gives me a break, realizing some of the emotional stresses I&rsquo;m under, and also tries to help pick up my slack.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/when-you-view-your-spouse-as-an-obstacle/ class="link black dim">When You View Your Spouse as an Obstacle</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Recently, someone in church said something that completely resonated with me in so many ways, and I instantly started writing a bunch of thoughts on it that I had.

She talked about how we sometimes look at people as obstacles, and how doing so gives us such a negative attitude and perspective on our situations with them.

In week&rsquo;s like this, it can be difficult to find something to be joyous about. But I did.

I&rsquo;ve been watching cooking shows lately, and have heard the term &ldquo;elevate&rdquo; be used a lot.

There have been a few things in our marriage this week that has brought me joy! :) But one main thing that I have found joy in this week was in our ultimate cereal date night on Friday!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshly-married-4-year-anniversary-giveaway/ class="link black dim">Freshly Married 4-Year Anniversary Giveaway!</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">HAPPY FOUR YEARS!

You can only prepare so much in these situations, but guess what? Making a will is something that you CAN prepare for.
After learning about wills and estates in a family finances class, I started realizing how important it is to have a will in place for your family’s protection, especially if you have many assets you want to leave behind for your spouse and children.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-24/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 24</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">This picture from last October is one of the most fun moments with some of my family members.

I&rsquo;ve kind of shared it mysteriously on here because we didn&rsquo;t want to say anything until we had good news, but my husband actually got laid off his job a month ago.

Some spouses let their frustrations escalate to the point where they say things they later regret. Sometimes one spouse completely shuts down and stops talking altogether. Sometimes the conflict never gets discussed again because the issue caused so much stress and problems.

I get that it&rsquo;s a loving way of trying to say that children have enriched your life in a way that you would never want to change, and that you can&rsquo;t imagine life without them.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/how-often-should-you-be-having-sex/ class="link black dim">How Often Should You Be Having Sex?</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links. I think two big questions that married couples, especially newlyweds, have on their minds when it comes to sex are:
How often or frequent should we be having sex? Does more sex make for a happier marriage? I’m going to give some insight that can help answer these two questions if you have been asking them yourself!
THE FACTS + FINDINGS There are several studies that have been done out there to determine what the &ldquo;magic number&rdquo; is for answering this question.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-15/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 15</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The joy I focused on in my marriage this week: that I have the power and influence of Christ in my relationship. I would say “found” in my marriage like I normally do, but the thing is I’ve always known it. It’s just that I have daily reminders on weeks like this one, preparing for Easter.
In the blog post: &ldquo;Christlike Attributes and my Marriage,&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve shared about the ways that his wonderful examples have positively influenced the way that we interact with each other.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/how-to-be-your-spouses-first-responder/ class="link black dim">How To Be Your Spouse's First Responder</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Last month, I read an article about parents needing to be their child’s “first responder” in a crisis.

I can absolutely attest that this concept works because my parents did this for me as a teenager.

Yesterday we went to a Latter-Day Saint temple together to do some service, since it&rsquo;s been like 4 or 5 months since we last went.
When we first got married we made a goal to go once a month because we feel spiritually lifted individually and in our marriage when we go. We kept that up for about the first two years, but the past two years it has been about every 6-10 weeks.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/video-books-i-recommend-for-sexual-intimacy-help/ class="link black dim">Video: Books I Recommend For Sexual Intimacy Help</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links.
In March I did a live video on Facebook talking about different books on sexual intimacy that I would recommend to couples. There was great feedback on that video, and it sounded like several people appreciated it! So I wanted to make sure it was published on my website for others to access as well.
I only share three books in this video, but I think they are so great for helping couples enrich their sexual intimacy, whether this part of their marriage is heavily struggling, or they could just use some more insight.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-joyful-marriage-week-13/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 13</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The joy I found in my marriage this week: Unity. Not everyone is going to agree with the decisions you are making as a couple and as a family. And sometimes those decisions can hurt other people, without meaning to.
So far in our 4 years of marriage, this is a recurring thing that comes up with the people around us, whether it&rsquo;s with our family, friends, or neighborhood, we&rsquo;ve had to do more balancing, say &ldquo;no&rdquo; a lot more, and even drop some friends.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/same-old-dates/ class="link black dim">Same Old Dates</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">THE SPECIAL OCCASION PRESSURES The night before Valentine&rsquo;s Day, we were talking about our holiday plans and my husband voiced to me that he has spent hours over the past few weeks trying to figure out a special activity for us to do for Valentine&rsquo;s Day that wasn&rsquo;t something we had already done or that feels &ldquo;same ole, same ole&rdquo; like going to the movies.

I think one of the biggest hangups a couple can have when it comes to their sex life is not understanding their own sexuality first. It makes me sad that so many married people don’t even understand this huge part of their life and who they are. Which is like, the basis of a satisfying sex life for both husband and wife!
Why it&rsquo;s important SOOOO I want to talk just a little bit about this.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/ajoyfulmarriage-week-10/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 10</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The joy I found in my marriage this week: being reminded of all the family and friends cheering us on. I received two loving reminders this week:
I&rsquo;ve shared here and there that we&rsquo;re concerned about trying to have kids. I&rsquo;ll share more on that in another blog post, but basically, the last two weeks the situation we are in has been on the forefront of our minds. The unknown has been worrisome for us, but a text message I received from my mother-in-law this week expressed lots of love letting us know that the family is very supportive and comforting.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-the-six-second-kiss/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: The Six-Second Kiss</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">#freshfridays quote asking &ldquo;Have you had your six-second kiss today?&rdquo;
I don&rsquo;t think we should look at the word &lsquo;potential&rsquo; with an eye-roll, because it doesn&rsquo;t mean a long kiss has to lead to sex. An extra long kiss is just more special than the quick kiss goodbye or quick kiss when getting home from work.
So I think the &lsquo;potential&rsquo; he&rsquo;s referring to is focused more on how that kind of intentional and more meaningful kiss can lead to a more meaningful relationship; more meaningful days together; more meaningful emotional intimacy.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/selflessness-the-key-to-great-emotional-physical-intimacy/ class="link black dim">Selflessness: The Key to Great Emotional & Physical Intimacy</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">*This post contains affiliate links.
I truly believe in selflessness. I’ve spoken about this before on different videos and blog post topics because pride or selflessness influences every single aspect of marriage!
I believe that when both spouses are being selfless, it can begin this beautiful cycle of deeper connection and more physical satisfaction. What was that last feeling? Physical satisfaction? YEP. Let’s talk about it!
To apply this “cycle” to sexual intimacy, if you are putting your spouse first, wanting them to have a satisfying experience, they will want to give you a satisfying experience right back.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/ajoyfulmarriage-week-9/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 9</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The joy I found in my marriage this week: There are still new things to discover about each other.

I remember being single not having a consistent person to rely on. Yes, I had loving family and friends but they also have their own lives and their own problems. In marriage, though, your spouse becomes your number one priority and so you get to experience that loving feeling of being taken care of.
There are days where I feel bad that my husband has to deal with my bad days whether I&rsquo;m either emotionally down in the dumps, or just not feeling well physically.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/ajoyfulmarriage-week-8/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 8</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The Joy I found in my marriage this week: Resiliency!

Whether or not couples therapy is successful for them (it seems like it is since they are still married), this statement is so powerful!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/9-misconceptions-about-therapy/ class="link black dim">9 Misconceptions About Therapy</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">To say there are so many stereotypes and stigmas out there associated with therapists and therapy is an understatement. Therapists are often portrayed in movies and TV shows as jokes, and I&rsquo;m not sure why, because seeking help for your mental and emotional state of mind is not a casual or comical thing! It&rsquo;s also just as important to keep yourself emotionally healthy as it is to keep yourself physically healthy!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/seeing-a-therapist-my-own-experiences/ class="link black dim">Seeing a Therapist: My Own Experiences</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I am sharing my experiences because I believe that the more positively we talk about therapy, the less stigma attached to it, and the more likely people are to seek help and actually get the help they need.

(Just to preface this, I&rsquo;ll refer to both counseling and therapy as one sometimes, just so it&rsquo;s more simple to read, but the two professions are slightly different.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/ajoyfulmarriage-week-4/ class="link black dim">A Joyful Marriage - Week 4</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I feel like a lot of things this week have been telling me &ldquo;No.&rdquo;

You read books, watch movies and TV shows, and even hear from others of crappy situations marriages find themselves dealing with like affairs or continual dishonesty, but it doesn&rsquo;t hit you how real it all is until you&rsquo;ve actually been married for a few years, and when things happen to people around you.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/disapproving-parents-how-to-handle-it-and-why-you-should-do-that-now/ class="link black dim">Disapproving Parents: How to Handle it and Why You Should Do That Now</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">My heart hurts every time I hear my friends, neighbors, etc. tell me that their parents still don&rsquo;t approve of their spouse.

If our difficulty is disagreeing on something important, I get the chance to see another perspective I didn&rsquo;t see before.

When people say that marriage is &ldquo;hard work&rdquo; (which it is!), it&rsquo;s important to explain what kind of work that means so newlyweds don&rsquo;t think exhaustion and stress is all they are getting into!

I love this phrase because though being a spouse has its difficult moments, it&rsquo;s still such a rewarding life! This phrase is all about looking at the positive in marriage! There have been a few rough things we&rsquo;ve had to experience in our marriage, but even in those times I find myself taking on this mindset, that the good outweighs the bad, and that I wouldn&rsquo;t rather be with anyone else :)</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-what-will-you-do-today/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays: What Will You Do Today</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;282060301&rdquo; ]
This question is so important to the #freshlymarried perspective! I believe that our daily positive actions add up to create a strong marriage, and asking ourselves this question can help us do that.
For those of you wondering what the word &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; has to do with my overall marriage message, you can read more here :) But using a quick example: when restaurants have items specifically made fresh that day and not days earlier, that&rsquo;s a restaurant you want to eat at, right?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-real-love-your-spouse-challenge/ class="link black dim">The Real 'Love Your Spouse' Challenge</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;282060156&rdquo; ]
So I got nominated to do that &lsquo;Love Your Spouse&rsquo; Challenge, but I&rsquo;m not going to do it. It might be surprising since I&rsquo;m a huge advocate of marriage, and that I totally admire this challenge going around! It&rsquo;s important to publically share your feelings about your spouse, acknowledge their talents and how they have influenced your marriage, etc. But I think there can be TOO much of that sometimes.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-i-have-a-choice/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: I Have a Choice</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I want to gear this #freshfridays quote towards our emotions.

It&rsquo;s not easy being a spouse to someone who suffers from a depression disorder or anxiety disorder. There&rsquo;s much patience required and it might be harder to understand if you have never experienced it before. Some spouses go into marriage with someone who suffers from depression not knowing how much of a mental and physical toll it can also have on themselves. And sadly, many couples go into marriage thinking that because they are so in love with their soulmate, their depression is gone.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/depression-in-marriage-how-your-spouse-affects-your-depression/ class="link black dim">Depression in Marriage: How Your Spouse Affects Your Depression</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;276707574&rdquo; ]
I love this quote. This reflects what my husband has done for me and I feel nothing but overwhelming gratitude when I think about it. Spouses hold an amazing power to love you through your mistakes and weaknesses. They may be the only people close enough, and willing to understand those mistakes and weaknesses. It&rsquo;s such a vulnerable thing, and for them to still stand by your side and come out loving you MORE is just amazing.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/depression-in-your-marriage-the-dos-and-donts/ class="link black dim">Depression in Your Marriage: The Do's and Don'ts</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">[sc name=&ldquo;soundcloud&rdquo; id=&ldquo;276706899&rdquo; ]
It seems more people have been coming out and sharing that they suffer from depression and/or anxiety. Whether it&rsquo;s just during postpartum or a life-long struggle, it&rsquo;s not easy to battle, and not easy to share with everyone that you are among them. I&rsquo;m grateful that more people are sharing this because it is not uncommon. We all experience hard and even traumatic things, and sometimes the explanation is just that the brain chemicals are imbalanced which causes the bouts of depression.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-power-of-empathy/ class="link black dim">The Power of Empathy</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">“The truth is, Rarely can a response make something better.

Put in the work to have the marriage you want or you won&rsquo;t get it.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/making-an-effort-two-is-better-than-one/ class="link black dim">How to Try New Techniques, Even If Your Spouse Won't</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">The use of techniques are found in our everyday activities; at your job, in your hobbies, cleaning your house, cooking, or driving a car. Each one of these requires the use of a skill or ability that you have learned that has helped you perform better in these various activities. Guess what? This idea can also be applied to your personal roles, such as being a spouse.
It&rsquo;s naive to think that knowing how to be married should come naturally.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-5-to-1-ratio/ class="link black dim">The 5 to 1 Ratio</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">For those of you who don&rsquo;t know John Gottman, he&rsquo;s basically the number one guy in understanding couples and marriages. He&rsquo;s also really fun to listen to! I respect him for his many theories in marriage, but this one is one of my favs because it&rsquo;s fairly easy to remember AND it makes a daily impact on your marriage! It&rsquo;s called the 5 to 1 ratio for healthier marriages.
How it works For every 1 negative thing we do in our relationship, it should be accompanied by 5 positive things**.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-quote-look-for-the-virtues/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: Look For The Virtues</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">“…There would be far less of divorce, much less of infidelity, much less of anger and rancor and quarreling.

Looking for the good in your spouse daily — YES that’s DEFINITELY a smart technique to use in marriage!
Look for the good, look for the positive, and look for the reasons why you fell in love with them in the first place.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-abc-formula/ class="link black dim">The ABC Formula</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">One dilemma all marriages find themselves in is how to best tell their partner how they are feeling. What I mean by this is that sometimes when we try bringing up an issue with our spouse, we start it off with blaming or obvious anger. Think of the last time you started off a conversation like this. How did it work out for you?? If a conversation starts off like this, it will most likely end like this too.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/6-ways-to-prioritize-your-spouse/ class="link black dim">6 Ways to Prioritize Your Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A reader asked what I would suggest as ways to prioritize your spouse, and I decided to put all that information in a post because my reply is too big for a comment box! haha. So here&rsquo;s my reply to my previous post: &ldquo;Prioritizing My Spouse.&rdquo;
The idea of growing apart happens gradually over time. When you think about it, there will always be sudden situations that come up where you do need to be there for your kids over your spouse, but I think the problem starts when this is happening frequently.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/a-marriage-is-a-family-too/ class="link black dim">A Marriage is a Family, Too</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Sometimes I get the feeling that people take marriage for granted or discount its importance. I&rsquo;m not just saying that because I&rsquo;m a marriage guru, or because I don&rsquo;t understand what it&rsquo;s like to have children of my own yet! From conversations I have had with people lately, they have made comments that appear to me as devaluing a family that only consists of husband and wife. It&rsquo;s as if they think a married couple simply on their own isn&rsquo;t good enough, or isn&rsquo;t a &ldquo;family&rdquo; compared to a married couple with children.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/invest-more-in-your-marriage-than-in-your-kids/ class="link black dim">Invest More in Your Marriage Than in Your Kids</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A HAPPY AND HEALTHY FAMILY BEGINS WITH MARRIAGE In the previous post connected to this, I discussed how it&rsquo;s becoming more normal to put less importance on marriage and more importance on kids. I think that this normalized mindset has given people this idea that a family only consisting of a husband and wife isn&rsquo;t good enough compared to a family that has a husband, wife, and kids.

Our time is very valuable as married couples, individuals, and parents. Weekends seem to be dispersed between your own events and obligations, family events, or just plain staying home on a Saturday night relaxing! If you got kids, throw in their games and activities, too.

When these stories are played out in movies, of course, we finally get to see it all played out visually so everything is played up.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/if-i-could-go-back/ class="link black dim">If We Could Go Back</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">There are many things in the beginning of marriage that we don&rsquo;t know about or fully understand until we have been married for at least a few years.

Principles to follow I firmly know that the principles taught in my Latter-Day Saint faith and many other faiths directly coincide with principles you should follow for a strong and happy marriage.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/freshfridays-question-you-are-not-a-tree/ class="link black dim">#freshfridays Quote: You Are Not a Tree</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I love this. Great advice for life but even better advice for marriage. If your marriage is in a &ldquo;rut&rdquo; you don&rsquo;t have to settle for that stage. You both have the power to make the changes that will put you in a stage you feel happy with. Whether it&rsquo;s making sacrifices, behavioral changes, or getting more outside help, you can make it happen. Think about that as you answer the #freshfridays question: &ldquo;What change can you make TODAY to freshen up your marriage?</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-importance-of-family-photos/ class="link black dim">The Importance of Family Photos</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">As you have noticed, we got some new family photos done :) And I&rsquo;m loving them! I had been watching my friend Nicky post so many amazing pictures she has taken of families and couples, and knew that she could give us the memorable photos we were looking for.

Bittersweet decisions Throughout the past years I&rsquo;ve come to know what&rsquo;s most important in life. (Maybe it&rsquo;s the selflessness I had to learn going into marriage, or maybe it&rsquo;s just maturity? haha) It&rsquo;s a bittersweet answer for me when I ask myself questions about the things I&rsquo;m currently doing in my life.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/theres-nothing-wrong-with-missing-your-spouse/ class="link black dim">There's Nothing Wrong With Missing Your Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">A few weeks ago Trevor went to a conference in San Francisco for work.

On our first date, Trevor and I started talking about some things we like to do, and we found most of them we had in common (of course!) Since he had recently come home from serving an Latter-Day Saint mission, I started suggesting some of the movies he should watch and music to listen to that came out while he was gone. It started as that, and then somehow it turned into things that we were possibly going to do together&mldr; :) So being the list people that we are, Trevor pulled out his phone and created a google doc, listing these things to do.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/putting-your-spouse-before-children/ class="link black dim">Prioritizing My Spouse</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I used to be one of those people that thought you should do anything and everything for your kids - that they should be the priority. It&rsquo;s portrayed in movies of parents willing to do anything for their kids.

All the world&rsquo;s a stage I think each of us are on a stage.

I fell into some common pitfalls of comparing my life to other people&rsquo;s lives, questioning how &ldquo;real&rdquo; people were, and spending more time being involved in it than I should have (though I wouldn&rsquo;t say I was addicted). These things were lowering my self-worth, and making me feel ungrateful.

It can be harder to accomplish this personal goal when married.

In the short time we have been married, we have learned so much about marriage and about each other. One important thing that I have learned is COMPROMISE!! Compromise is so important, especially if you and your husband have different interests, like Josh and I do.
When Josh and I got married, we promised each other we would not be the stereotypical American couple that ends up in a divorce court in 5 years.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/lets-commemorate-something/ class="link black dim">Six Month Anniversary - Let's Commemorate Something</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Trevor laughs at all the little moments in our relationship I try to commemorate, or that I feel the need to commemorate.

I have several moments where I have so much gratitude for my spouse that I want to shout to the world, “I have the cutest husband!” However, I’m realizing that a better, more respectful thing to say, would be something along the lines of, “My husband is perfect for me” or “I’m so thankful for my husband.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/you-are-the-most-beautiful-creature/ class="link black dim">You Are The Most Beautiful Creature On Planet Earth</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Amy asked me this morning, &ldquo;Am I beautiful?&rdquo; I was thinking, &ldquo;Of course you are beautiful!&rdquo; But I know many of you women reading this ask the same thing. It&rsquo;s obvious that many women are self-conscious about the way they look.

I know many of you think that the topic of food storage is one that older people are involved in.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-three-month-milestone/ class="link black dim">The Three Month Milestone</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">In our first three months together, I learned: Routines are comfortably nice.

Photography Pictures were taken with family and friends on the temple grounds, and afterwards, Trevor and I spent about an hour taking pictures just us and the photographer. I know many people do groomals before-hand, so that the wedding day isn’t rushed.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/lds-weddings-101-the-planning/ class="link black dim">LDS Weddings 101: The Planning</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">I would like to start out, by saying how much I loved my wedding day. From the Groom to the ceremony; to the decorations to the guests; and from the food to the fun, I loved it all! Of course, the day had a few blips, but that is inevitable! What it all came down to, was that I had just married the most perfect man for me, and we were celebrating that fact with people who loved and supported us.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/top-10-cheap-date-ideas/ class="link black dim">Top 10 Cheap Date Ideas</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Life is busy. There seems to be a never-ending list of stuff to fill our time with: work, school, errands, meal preparation, eating, sleeping, cleaning, exercise, church responsibilities, hobbies, appointments, social activities&mldr; You get the point :)
Life can easily suffocate our schedules with endless commitments without leaving time for the ones we love most. To avoid this, my wife and I have set a goal to have an official date night at least once a week.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/note-to-self/ class="link black dim">Note To Self</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">Remember to cut the price tag off of your brand new blouse before you wear it to Sacrament meeting, in giving a talk at the pulpit, in front of a large congregation.
It’s fine. My husband slyly pulled it off after I sat back down.
Well, the time came, sooner than I had expected, that we were asked to speak in Sacrament meeting. To many of you, this may surprise you, but we actually enjoyed it.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-three-week-milestone/ class="link black dim">The Three Week Milestone</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">In the first three weeks of being married, I learned: The difference between wants and needs.

Saturday was Trevor&rsquo;s (before me) best friend&rsquo;s wedding. It was a beautiful, yet hot, day full of love and happiness for them. It was a long-awaited day for them, especially since we both started dating within a week of each other, and were engaged about the same time. It was so hard for those boys! They were so in love with us and they just kept waiting until we fully came around!</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/buns-bananas-and-bbq-chicken/ class="link black dim">Buns, Bananas, And BBQ Chicken</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">My husband asks me out on a date every week. I KNOW RIGHT?! He really is the cutest husband. We had our partial date tonight in the park, having a picnic together. We grabbed the cute woven basket my cute mother-in-law gave us, and packed it full of buns, bananas, and BBQ chicken. It was lovely just sitting on the lush, green, grass, just eating, talking, and laughing. Trevor makes me giggle so much.</div></div></div></div><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white"><div class="relative w-100 mb4 bg-white nested-copy-line-height"><div class="bg-white mb3 pa4 gray overflow-hidden"><span class="f6 db">Posts</span><h1 class="f3 near-black"><a href=/the-iron-2/ class="link black dim">The Iron</a></h1><div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">We just bought a new iron two weeks ago. I was excited to play wifey with it, and iron things for my husband, just like the movies show wives and moms doing. (some of you might chuckle at that). So while Trevor went to run errands, I thought I would try it out on his dress shirts, and have them wrinkle-free for his Sunday-dress.
You need to know two things before you judge me.</div></div></div></div></section></div></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.com>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
