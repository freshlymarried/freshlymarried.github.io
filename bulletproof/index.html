The shocked part of me thinks: &ldquo;I swear they all just got married yesterday!&rdquo; And then the realistic part of me remembers that high school was 7 years ago and a lot can happen whether people got married right out of high school or more recently.  Because I&rsquo;m in this same grouping, it gives me mixed feelings, realizing that divorce truly is a possibility, but that I&rsquo;m glad I have the strong marriage I have.</p><p>I talk about having strong marriages so much that I sometimes forget how often divorce happens. And when it does happen, I admittedly can&rsquo;t help but wonder what the reasoning was for it. Not that divorce situations aren&rsquo;t justified, but that it can be very surprising when you remember how cute they were together or how strong their relationship seemed.  Some personalities just really don&rsquo;t mesh well. Some people make bad mistakes. Some people won&rsquo;t change. Some people aren&rsquo;t willing to go through the hard work. <strong>Even though often times divorce is for the best, it&rsquo;s still a hard poke in your gut reminding you that not everyone makes it on this journey.</strong></p><p><img src=/images/IMG_0314.jpg alt="divorce, sad reality of divorce, newlywed divorce, reality of divorce, understanding divorce, divorce is common 20% of marriages are divorced by 5 years, divorce rate, fearful of divorce, marriage advice, marriage help, marriage101, relationship advice, relationship expert, marriage specialist, getting marital help, friend divorcing, divorced friends"></p><hr><h2 id=sad-reasons-for-good-reminders>SAD REASONS FOR GOOD REMINDERS</h2><p>In the beginning of marriage there are many transitions to experience and many things you discover about your spouse that you didn&rsquo;t know before. Some couples handle or work through those transitions better than others. The first five years can be the most difficult for a couple, which is why 20% of marriages are either separated or divorced by their 5-year anniversary*. <strong>So based on this statistic, if it&rsquo;s not me it&rsquo;s one of the four couples I know&mldr; I guess it&rsquo;s just a statistic you hear until you find out it applies to someone you know!</strong> It&rsquo;s in the moment of finding out that tends to put my own marriage in perspective.</p><ul><li>I am reminded that the lovey-dovey-ness of being engaged, dating a lot, and being first married doesn&rsquo;t last for some people.</li><li>I am reminded that maybe I need to be MORE lovey-dovey than I have been.</li><li>I am reminded to not let my marriage take a backseat to something else or someone else who is far less important.</li><li>I am reminded that I can&rsquo;t take my marriage for granted.</li><li>I am reminded that we truly can&rsquo;t let things get in the way of our union progressing.</li><li>And I&rsquo;m reminded that if things <em>have</em> gotten in the way, we need to address them even though it&rsquo;s freakin&rsquo; hard at times.</li></ul><h2 id=the-sad-but-true-reality>THE Sad but True Reality</h2><p>It&rsquo;s interesting how your perspective changes with time. For example, I remember our strong attitude of &ldquo;This is going to last forever! Nothing can break us apart!&rdquo; We just felt like we were so solid, on the same page, and truly appreciated everything about each other :) We still are somewhat this way today, even though we have out of sync days just like every other couple does, too. <strong>The difference is that we thought we were bulletproof; that nothing could touch us. But the reality is we&rsquo;re not. No marriage is because we can&rsquo;t control every single bullet that might come at us for our entire marriage.</strong> What we <em>can</em> control is strengthening our shield, because that will help us react to the bullets better. If we have a strong enough shield built up then the shots fired only feel like the wind getting knocked out of us. But without a strong shield that you both are sturdily holding onto, there&rsquo;s nothing stopping those bullets from making you bleed.</p><p><img src=/images/we-are-not-bulletproof.png alt="divorce, sad reality of divorce, newlywed divorce, reality of divorce, understanding divorce, divorce is common 20% of marriages are divorced by 5 years, divorce rate, fearful of divorce, marriage advice, marriage help, marriage101, relationship advice, relationship expert, marriage specialist, getting marital help, friend divorcing, divorced friends"></p><p>Sorry if that visual comparison sounded grim or harsh, haha, but hey it&rsquo;s the #truth you guys. We all tend to be naive about marriage at some point and it&rsquo;s not fun having your head brought down from the clouds when hearing things like this. It&rsquo;s in these moments, however, that I find changes I can make to strengthen my marriage, so that I can afford to be on cloud 9 more often :)</p><p>So I encourage you to take this opportunity to strengthen your shield TOGETHER. It has to be a team effort or you will not see progress. Find those things you could be better at and work on them. Keep trying! It&rsquo;s OK if you need help from a counselor, too! Do what needs to be done in order to get back to your Cloud 9.</p><hr><h6 id=featured-photo-by-nicholette-photography>Featured Photo by: Nicholette Photography</h6><p><em>*  Resource: Walsh, F.
