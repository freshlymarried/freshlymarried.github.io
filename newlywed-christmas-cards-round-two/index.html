attempt last year</a>! This year I did a double-sided card so we could have a picture of us and a quick &ldquo;happy holidays&rdquo; message, but also have a back where we shared a picture from something special we did this year: we threw a Back to the Future party because I&rsquo;m obsessed with BTTF! To share a pertinent quote that would send positive vibes to our family and friends about the new year was just an added touch that I loved!</p><p><a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1900.jpg><img src=/images/IMG_1900.jpg alt="christmas cards, cold nose warm wishes, newlywed christmas cards, newlywed christmas cards ideas, christmas card tips and tricks, simplifying christmas cards, couple christmas cards, newlywed christmas cards fails, newlywed christmas card successes"></a></p><h4 id=simplifying>Simplifying</h4><p>I simplified much more than last year! I created a pre-made card from Walgreens, because of the convenience and timing. They actually had some stylish designs, so you don&rsquo;t always have to get them from some nice online store. Instead of handwriting a message in each folded card, I chose to just do a typed newsletter that everyone would get. It helped on time but it probably seemed more authentic than my rushed handwritten message, too haha. I have started to see that each year will get more simple because:</p><ul><li>I didn&rsquo;t have to gather as many new addresses as I did last year, which was a huge time-saver! Gathering a bunch of addresses can be time-consuming, surprisingly. Many people we know actually moved this year so we did have to double-check on those new addresses. However, despite factoring in that possibility, I know next year will still be less daunting in this area.</li><li>I now have a newsletter outline and template to keep following, so next year I just have to fill in the different bits of information of what happened in 2016.</li><li>I&rsquo;m starting to get the hang of it and also learned things I can do differently in the future. I learned when the best time to prepare is, and when the worst time is. I learned when I would be too busy to handle the task and when would be easier. I knew which sites to spend my time browsing their pre-designed cards because of the research I did last year on comparing pricing, timing, and designs.</li></ul><h4 id=christmas-cards-cold-nose-warm-wishes-newlywed-christmas-cards-newlywed-christmas-cards-ideas-christmas-card-tips-and-tricks-simplifying-christmas-cards-couple-christmas-cards-newlywed-christmas-cards-fails-newlywed-christmas-card-successesimagesimg_1913jpghttpfreshlymarriedcomwp-contentuploads201512img_1913jpg><a href=http://freshlymarried.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_1913.jpg><img src=/images/IMG_1913.jpg alt="christmas cards, cold nose warm wishes, newlywed christmas cards, newlywed christmas cards ideas, christmas card tips and tricks, simplifying christmas cards, couple christmas cards, newlywed christmas cards fails, newlywed christmas card successes"></a></h4><h4 id=caring-is-sharing>Caring is sharing</h4><p>Not only did I simplify the actual card itself, but I also cared more about doing it this time. We had a big year! Lots happened and we wanted to share that with family and friends. This card felt more important to send for a few reasons:</p><ul><li>Achieving my undergrad just a few weeks ago was a big highlight and accomplishment to let people know about. However, I honestly just wanted to help remind my relatives of what degree I majored in so I won&rsquo;t have to keep repeating it&mldr; LOL. (We all know it gets old at times having to repeat the same spiel to people of what your goals are!)</li><li>I truly enjoyed receiving a newsletter or a card that at least had a few of their year&rsquo;s highlights listed so that I could grow closer to that family. One of our neighbors gave us one and I got to know them so much better simply through a typed letter, even though it was the same for everyone. We all assume everyone is on social media and can see what we post but that&rsquo;s not always the case. Not everyone gets on all the time, or not everyone posts something on a weekly basis about their family. You can share more in a card.</li></ul><hr><p>I do think there will be a round three of sending out cards next year, because I feel it will get easier in some ways as the years go on. I found that cards are meaningful to many people, even if you might think they aren&rsquo;t. I also  found Christmas cards to be informative and a good reminder, especially ones that tell a few things about what happened to their family this year. I remember getting a dove chocolate that contained a &ldquo;promise&rdquo; message on the wrapper saying, &ldquo;If old acquaintance be forgot, give them a call and remember.&rdquo; It goes off of &ldquo;Auld Lang Syne&rdquo; of course, but I want to change up that message that <strong>if old acquaintance be forgot, send them a card and remember!</strong> :)</p><ul class=pa0><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/all class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">all</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/celebrate class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">celebrate</a></li><li class="list di"><a href=/tags/journal class="link f5 grow no-underline br-pill ba ph3 pv2 mb2 dib black sans-serif">journal</a></li></ul><div class="mt6 instapaper_ignoref"></div></div><aside class="w-30-l mt6-l"><div class="bg-light-gray pa3 nested-list-reset nested-copy-line-height nested-links"><p class="f5 b mb3">Related</p><ul class="pa0 list"><li class=mb2><a href=/5-ways-to-keep-christmas-gifts-a-surprise-from-your-spouse/>5 Ways to Keep Christmas Gifts a Surprise From Your Spouse</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/be-thankful/>Be Thankful and Count the Blessings</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/the-pressures-of-newlywed-bucket-lists/>The Pressures of Newlywed Bucket Lists</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/life-is-sweet-in-the-belly-of-the-beast/>Life is Sweet in The Belly of The Beast</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/complete-rather-than-compete/>Complete Rather Than Compete</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/our-first-year-being-homeowners/>Our First Year Being Homeowners</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/the-iron-part-2/>The Iron: Part 2</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/why-an-associate-degree-is-a-big-deal-to-me/>Why An Associate Degree Is a Big Deal To Me</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/second-anniversary/>Second Anniversary</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/an-ok-cliche/>An OK Cliche</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/the-difference-a-picture-can-make/>The Difference a Picture Can Make</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/new-years-resolutions-married-style/>New Year's Resolutions: Married-Style</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/newlywed-christmas-cards/>Newlywed Christmas Cards</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/the-married-student-ward-experience/>The Married Student Ward Experience</a></li><li class=mb2><a href=/our-first-apartment/>Our First Apartment</a></li></ul></div></aside></article></main><footer class="bg-black bottom-0 w-100 pa3" role=contentinfo><div><a class="f4 fw4 hover-white no-underline white-70 dn dib-ns pv2 ph3" href=https://freshlymarried.com>&copy; Freshly Married 2022</a></div><div class="white-70 pv2 ph3"><small>This site does not provide medical or mental health counseling advice, diagnosis or treatment.
